      "\n",
      "towards him through the valley; and he prepared to receive him and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "encountered him violently. Having broken both their lances, they drew\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their swords and fought blade to blade. Then Owain struck the knight a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blow through his helmet, headpiece, and visor, and through the skin,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the flesh, and the bone, until it wounded the very brain. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "black knight felt that he had received a mortal wound, upon which he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "turned his horse's head and fled. And Owain pursued him, and followed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "close upon him, although he was not near enough to strike him with his\r\n",

      "sword. Thereupon Owain descried a vast and resplendent castle. And they\r\n",

      "behind the saddle, and cut him in two and carried away the rowels of\r\n",

      "the spurs that were upon Owain's heels. And the portcullis descended\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the floor. And the rowels of the spurs and part of the horse were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "without; and Owain, with the other part of the horse, remained between\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the two gates, and the inner gate was closed, so that Owain could not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go thence; and Owain was in a perplexing situation. And, while he was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in this state, he could see through an aperture in the gate a street\r\n",
      "\n",
      "facing him, with a row of houses on each side. And he beheld a maiden,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with yellow curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon her head; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she was clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet were shoes of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "variegated leather. And she approached the gate, and desired that it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold thy peace!\" said Kai, \"and go after the knight who went hence\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the meadow, and take from him the goblet, and overthrow him, and\r\n",

      "possess thyself of his horse and arms, and then thou shalt receive the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "armor for myself.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence!\" said the knight. \"Go back to the court, and tell Arthur,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from me, either to come himself, or to send some other to fight with\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "thereupon he struck him with a sharp-pointed fork, and it hit him in\r\n",

      "\"Verily,\" said Owain the son of Urien to Kai, \"thou wert ill advised\r\n",

      "things must befall him. He must either be overthrown, or slain. If\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he is overthrown by the knight, he will be counted by him to be an\r\n",
      "\n",
      "honorable person of the court; and an eternal disgrace will it be to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur and his warriors. And if he is slain, the disgrace will be the\r\n",

      "same, and, moreover, his sin will be upon him: therefore will I go to\r\n",

      "And the old man was lame. Peredur rode to the palace; and the door\r\n",

      "\n",
      "sitting on a cushion, and a large blazing fire burning before him. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the household and the company arose to meet Peredur, and disarrayed\r\n",

      "him. And the man asked the youth to sit on the cushion; and they sat\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down and conversed together. When it was time, the tables were laid,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and they went to meat. And when they had finished their meal, the man\r\n",

      "yellow-haired youth if thou canst.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So Peredur arose, and went to play with the yellow-haired youth; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he lifted up his arm, and struck him such a mighty blow that his brow\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fell over his eye, and the blood flowed forth.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my life,\" said the man, \"come now, and sit down; for thou wilt\r\n",

      "\n",
      "thy uncle, thy mother's brother. And with me shalt thou remain a space\r\n",

      "in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "courtesy, and gentleness, and noble bearing. Leave, then, the habits\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And they had abundance of honor and service. And when it was time they\r\n",

      "went to sleep. At the break of day Peredur arose and took his horse,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and with his uncle's permission he rode forth. And he came to a vast\r\n",
      "\n",
      "desert wood, and at the further end of the wood was a meadow, and on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the other side of the meadow he saw a large castle. And thitherward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Peredur bent his way, and he found the gate open, and he proceeded\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the hall. And he beheld a stately hoary-headed man sitting on one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "side of the hall, and many pages around him, who arose to receive and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to honor Peredur. And they placed him by the side of the owner of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "palace. Then they discoursed together; and when it was time to eat,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they caused Peredur to sit beside the nobleman during the repast. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when they had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, the nobleman\r\n",
      "\n",
      "asked Peredur whether he could fight with a sword.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were I to receive instruction,\" said Peredur, \"I think I could.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there was on the floor of the hall a huge staple, as large as a\r\n",

      "warrior could grasp.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And Peredur placed them together, and they became entire as they were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "before. And a second time he struck upon the staple so that both it and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the sword broke in two, and as before they re-united. And the third\r\n",
      "\n",
      "time he gave a like blow, and placed the broken parts together, and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "of mighty size, with three streams of blood flowing from the point to\r\n",

      "the ground. And when all the company saw this they began wailing and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lamenting. But for all that the man did not break off his discourse\r\n",

      "with Peredur. And as he did not tell Peredur the meaning of what he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw, he forbore to ask him concerning it. And when the clamor had a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "little subsided, behold, two maidens entered, with a large salver\r\n",
      "\n",
      "between them, in which was a man's head, surrounded by a profusion of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "blood. And thereupon the company of the court made so great an outcry\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was irksome to be in the same hall with them. But at length\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they were silent. And, when time was that they should sleep, Peredur\r\n",

      "goods do I desire; for I need them not.\" Then Peredur rode forward,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he came to the palace of the Sons of the King of the Tortures. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when he entered the palace he saw none but women; and they rose up,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and were joyful at his coming; and, as they began to discourse with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, he beheld a charger arrive, with a saddle upon it and a corpse in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the saddle. And one of the women arose, and took the corpse from the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saddle, and anointed it in a vessel of warm water which was below the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "door, and placed precious balsam upon it. And the man rose up alive,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and came to the place where Peredur was, and greeted him, and was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "joyful to see him. And two other men came in upon their saddles; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden treated these two in the same manner as she had done the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "first. Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it was thus. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "told him that there was an Addanc in a cave, which slew them once every\r\n",
      "\n",
      "day. And thus they remained that night.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And next morning the youths arose to sally forth, and Peredur besought\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, for the sake of the ladies of their love, to permit him to go\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with them; but they refused him, saying, \"If thou shouldst be slain\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there, thou hast none to bring thee back to life again.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And they rode forward, and Peredur followed after them; and, after\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they had disappeared out of his sight, he came to a mound, whereon sat\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the fairest lady he had ever beheld.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know thy quest,\" said she. \"Thou art going to encounter the Addanc,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he will slay thee, and that not by courage, but by craft. He has\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a cave, and at the entrance of the cave there is a stone pillar, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he sees every one that enters, and none see him; and from behind the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pillar he slays every one with a poisonous dart. And, if thou wouldst\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pledge me thy faith to love me above all women, I would give thee a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "stone by which thou shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not see thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, by my troth,\" said Peredur; \"for, when first I beheld thee, I\r\n",

      "loved thee. And where shall I seek thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When thou seekest me, seek towards India.\" And the maiden vanished,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "after placing the stone in Peredur's hand.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "level meadows. And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sheep, and on the other a flock of black sheep. And whenever one of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "white sheep bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become\r\n",
      "\n",
      "white; and, when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would cross over and become black. And he saw a tall tree by the side\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the river, one half of which was in flames from the root to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "top, and the other half was green and in full leaf. And nigh thereto he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw a youth sitting upon a mound, and two greyhounds, white-breasted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and spotted, in leashes, lying by his side. And certain was he that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had never seen a youth of so royal a bearing as he. And in the wood\r\n",
      "\n",
      "opposite he heard hounds raising a herd of deer. And Peredur saluted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the youth, and the youth greeted him in return. And there were three\r\n",
      "\n",
      "roads leading from the mound: two of them were wide roads, and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "third was more narrow. And Peredur inquired where the three roads went.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of them goes to my palace,\" said the youth; \"and one of two things\r\n",

      "thee, and where thou wilt find my wife, or else remain here to see the\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "in the chase, kill them by the water beside us. And when it is time to\r\n",

      "\"With thy permission, young man, I will go that way.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Peredur went towards the cave. And he took the stone in his left\r\n",

      "hand, and his lance in his right. And as he went in he perceived the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Addanc, and he pierced him through with his lance, and cut off his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "head. And, as he came from the cave, behold, the three companions were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "at the entrance; and they saluted Peredur, and told him that there was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a prediction that he should slay that monster. And Peredur gave the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "head to the young men, and they offered him in marriage whichever of\r\n",

      "the three sisters he might choose, and half their kingdom with her.\r\n",

      "a wife, I should prefer your sister to all others.\" And Peredur rode\r\n",
      "\n",
      "forward, and he heard a noise behind him. And he looked back, and saw a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man upon a red horse, with red armor upon him. And the man rode up by\r\n",
      "\n",

      "the fairest he had ever seen. And he saw a beauteous maiden leaning\r\n",

      "her head out of a window of the tent, and he had never seen a maiden\r\n",

      "more lovely than she. And upon her was a garment of satin. And he\r\n",

      "from mid-day until evening; and then the tournament was ended, and he\r\n",

      "or blows, or else seeing a wonder.\"\r\n",

      "and sit upon the mound.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And upon the mound he sat. And while he sat there, they saw a lady, on\r\n",

      "a pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold around\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the horse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up towards the\r\n",

      "mound.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is not, lord,\" said they.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of them arose; and as he came upon the road to meet her she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "passed by, and he followed as fast as he could, being on foot; and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "greater was his speed, the farther was she from him. And when he saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that it profited him nothing to follow her, he returned to Pwyll, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said unto him, \"Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to follow her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "on foot.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"go unto the palace, and take the fleetest horse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that thou seest, and go after her.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he took a horse and went forward. And he came to an open level\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the farther was she from him. Yet she held the same pace as at first.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And his horse began to fail; and when his horse's feet failed him, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "returned to the place where Pwyll was.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord,\" said he, \"it will avail nothing for any one to follow yonder\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lady. I know of no horse in these realms swifter than this, and it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "availed me not to pursue her.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of a truth,\" said Pwyll, \"there must be some illusion here. Let us go\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the palace.\" So to the palace they went, and they spent that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "day. And the next day they arose, and that also they spent until it was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "time to go to meat. And after the first meal, \"Verily,\" said Pwyll, \"we\r\n",
      "\n",
      "will go, the same party as yesterday, to the top of the mound. And do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou,\" said he to one of his young men, \"take the swiftest horse that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou knowest in the field.\" And thus did the young man. And they went\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the mound, taking the horse with them. And as they were sitting\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down they beheld the lady on the same horse, and in the same apparel,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "coming along the same road. \"Behold,\" said Pwyll, \"here is the lady of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "yesterday. Make ready, youth, to learn who she is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said he, \"that will I gladly do.\" And thereupon the lady\r\n",
      "\n",
      "came opposite to them. So the youth mounted his horse; and before he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had settled himself in his saddle, she passed by, and there was a clear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "space between them. But her speed was no greater than it had been the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "day before. Then he put his horse into an amble, and thought, that,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "notwithstanding the gentle pace at which his horse went, he should soon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overtake her. But this availed him not: so he gave his horse the reins.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And still he came no nearer to her than when he went at a foot's pace.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more he urged his horse, the farther was she from him. Yet she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rode not faster than before. When he saw that it availed not to follow\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her, he returned to the place where Pwyll was. \"Lord,\" said he, \"the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse can no more than thou hast seen.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see indeed that it avails not that any one should follow her. And by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven,\" said he, \"she must needs have an errand to some one in this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain, if her haste would allow her to declare it. Let us go back to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the palace.\" And to the palace they went, and they spent that night in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "songs and feasting, as it pleased them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "meat. And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, \"Where are the hosts that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "went yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold, lord, we are here,\" said they.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go,\" said he, \"to the mound, to sit there. And do thou,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he to the page who tended his horse, \"saddle my horse well, and hasten\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with thee.\" And the youth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "did thus. And they went and sat upon the mound. And ere they had been\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there but a short time, they beheld the lady coming by the same road,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and in the same manner, and at the same pace. \"Young man,\" said Pwyll,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see the lady coming: give me my horse.\" And no sooner had he mounted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his horse than she passed him. And he turned after her, and followed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her. And he let his horse go bounding playfully, and thought that at\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the second step or the third he should come up with her. But he came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "no nearer to her than at first. Then he urged his horse to his utmost\r\n",
      "\n",
      "speed, yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her. Then said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Pwyll, \"O maiden, for the sake of him whom thou best lovest, stay for\r\n",

      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will stay gladly,\" said she, \"and it were better for thy horse hadst\r\n",

      "thou asked it long since.\" So the maiden stopped, and she threw back\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that part of her head-dress which covered her face. And she fixed her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "eyes upon him, and began to talk with him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My greeting be unto thee,\" said he. Then he thought that the beauty\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of all the maidens, and all the ladies that he had ever seen, was as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing compared to her beauty. \"Lady,\" he said, \"wilt thou tell me\r\n",

      "she should remain in that palace of Narberth until the end of seven\r\n",

      "years, and that she should sit every day near unto a horseblock that\r\n",

      "was without the gate; and that she should relate the story to all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "who should come there whom she might suppose not to know it already;\r\n",

      "and that she should offer the guests and strangers, if they would\r\n",

      "permit her, to carry them upon her back into the palace. But it rarely\r\n",

      "\n",
      "was an infant-boy in swaddling-clothes, wrapped around in a mantle of\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "there. And the name which they gave unto him was Gwri Wallt Euryn,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "because what hair was upon his head was as yellow as gold. And they\r\n",

      "the year was over he could walk stoutly; and he was larger than a boy\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of three years old, even one of great growth and size. And the boy was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nursed the second year, and then he was as large as a child six years\r\n",

      "boy and Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn. Now the semblance of Pwyll was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "well known to him, for he had of yore been one of his followers. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thereupon he became grieved for the wrong that he did in keeping with\r\n",

      "\n",
      "into the hall, and there was no man; and they went on to the castle,\r\n",

      "and to the sleeping-place, and they saw none; and in the mead-cellar\r\n",

      "go through the land and all the possessions that they had, and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "visited the houses and dwellings, and found nothing but wild beasts.\r\n",

      "fed upon the prey they killed in hunting, and the honey of the wild\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "Lloegyr, and seek some craft whereby we may gain our support.\" So\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they went into Lloegyr, and came as far as Hereford. And they betook\r\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves to making saddles. And Manawyddan began to make housings;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he gilded and colored them with blue enamel in the manner that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd. And he made the blue enamel as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was made by the other man. And therefore is it still called Calch\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasar [blue enamel], because Llasar Llaesgywydd had wrought it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan, neither\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all Hereford;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "till at length every one of the saddlers perceived that they were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "losing much of their gain, and that no man bought of them but him who\r\n",
      "\n",
      "could not get what he sought from Manawyddan. Then they assembled\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together, and agreed to slay him and his companions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they received warning of this, and took counsel whether they should\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leave the city. \"By Heaven,\" said Pryderi, \"it is not my counsel that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "we should quit the town, but that we should slay these boors.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" said Manawyddan; \"for, if we fight with them, we shall have\r\n",
      "\n",
      "evil fame, and shall be put in prison. It were better for us to go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "another town to maintain ourselves.\" So they four went to another city.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\"We will try,\" answered he. There they began to make shields, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fashioned them after the shape of the good shields they had seen; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they enamelled them, as they had done the saddles. And they prospered\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in that place, so that not a shield was asked for in the whole town,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "but such as was had of them. Rapid therefore was their work, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "numberless were the shields they made. But at last they were marked by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the craftsmen, who came together in haste, and their fellow-townsmen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with them, and agreed that they should seek to slay them. But they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received warning, and heard how the men had resolved on their\r\n",
      "\n",
      "destruction. \"Pryderi,\" said Manawyddan, \"these men desire to slay us.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us not endure this from these boors, but let us rather fall upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them and slay them.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Caswallawn and his men will hear of it, and we\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shall be undone. Let us go to another town.\" So to another town they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "went.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" he replied; \"but let us take to making shoes.\"\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I know,\" answered Manawyddan; \"and I will teach thee to stitch.\r\n",

      "We will not attempt to dress the leather; but we will buy it ready\r\n",

      "dressed, and will make the shoes from it.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and none other would he buy except the leather for the soles. And he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "associated himself with the best goldsmith in the town, and caused him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to make clasps for the shoes, and to gild the clasps; and he marked how\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was done, until he learned the method. And therefore he was called\r\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the three makers of gold shoes; and when they could be had from\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, not a shoe nor hose was bought of any of the cordwainers in the\r\n",

      "town. But when the cordwainers perceived that their gains were failing\r\n",
      "\n",
      "(for as Manawyddan shaped the work, so Pryderi stitched it), they came\r\n",

      "\"Rather let us slay them all.\"\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Not so,\" said Manawyddan: \"we will not slay them, neither will we\r\n",

      "remain in Lloegyr any longer. Let us set forth to Dyved and go to see\r\n",

      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So they journeyed along until they came to Dyved, and they went forward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Narberth. And there they kindled fire, and supported themselves by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hunting. And thus they spent a month. And they gathered their dogs\r\n",

      "around them, and tarried there one year.\r\n",

      "before them, and came to a small bush which was near at hand; but as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "soon as they were come to the bush they hastily drew back, and returned\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the men, their hair bristling up greatly. \"Let us go near to the\r\n",

      "bush,\" said Pryderi, \"and see what is in it.\" And as they came near,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "behold, a wild boar of a pure white color rose up from the bush. Then\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the dogs, being set on by the men, rushed towards him; but he left the\r\n",
      "\n",

      "the dogs, without retreating from them, until the men had come near.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the men came up, he fell back a second time, and betook him to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "flight. Then they pursued the boar until they beheld a vast and lofty\r\n",
      "\n",
      "castle, all newly built, in a place where they had never before seen\r\n",

      "himself and upon his horse. And truly they never before saw a knight,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "or a horse, or armor, of such remarkable size. And they were all near\r\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know him not,\" said he; \"and the strange armor that he wears\r\n",

      "the dwarf who the knight was.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Wherefore?\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because thou art not of honor sufficient to befit thee to speak to my\r\n",

      "\n",
      "which the dwarf struck her, with the whip that was in his hand, across\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the face and the eyes, until the blood flowed forth. And the maiden,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "through the hurt she received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar,\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf, and to be attacked unarmed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by the armed knight: so he returned to where Gwenhwyvar was.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "And the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and across\r\n",

      "the ford of the Usk. And they went along a fair and even and lofty\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ridge of ground until they came to a town, and at the extremity of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town they saw a fortress and a castle. And they came to the extremity\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the town. And as the knight passed through it, all the people arose\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and saluted him, and bade him welcome. And when Geraint came into the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town, he looked at every house to see if he knew any of those whom he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw. But he knew none, and none knew him to do him the kindness to let\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him have arms either as a loan or for a pledge. And every house he saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was full of men and arms and horses. And they were polishing shields,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and burnishing swords, and washing armor, and shoeing horses. And the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knight and the lady and the dwarf rode up to the castle that was in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "town, and every one was glad in the castle. And from the battlements\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the gates they risked their necks through their eagerness to greet\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, and to show their joy.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "castle. And when he was certain that he would do so, he looked around\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him; and at a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ruins, wherein was a hall that was falling to decay. And as he knew not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "any one in the town, he went towards the old palace; and when he came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "near to the palace he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of marble-stone\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leading to it. And upon the bridge he saw sitting a hoary-headed man,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon whom were tattered garments. And Geraint gazed steadfastly upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him for a long time. Then the hoary-headed man spoke to him. \"Young\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man,\" he said, \"wherefore art thou thoughtful?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thoughtful,\" said he, \"because I know not where to go to-night.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilt thou come forward this way, chieftain?\" said he, \"and thou shalt\r\n",
      "\n",
      "have the best that can be procured for thee.\" So Geraint went forward.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the hoary-headed man preceded him into the hall. And in the hall he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dismounted, and he left there his horse. Then he went on to the upper\r\n",
      "\n",
      "chamber with the hoary-headed man. And in the chamber he beheld an old\r\n",
      "\n",
      "decrepit woman sitting on a cushion, with old, tattered garments of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "satin upon her; and it seemed to him that he had never seen a woman\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fairer than she must have been when in the fulness of youth. And beside\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her was a maiden, upon whom were a vest and a veil that were old, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beginning to be worn out. And truly he never saw a maiden more full of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "comeliness and grace and beauty than she. And the hoary-headed man said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to the maiden, \"There is no attendant for the horse of this youth but\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thyself.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will render the best service I am able,\" said she, \"both to him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and to his horse.\" And the maiden disarrayed the youth, and then she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "furnished his horse with straw and with corn. And she went to the hall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as before, and then she returned to the chamber.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden, \"Go to the town,\" said he,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"and bring hither the best that thou canst find both of food and of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "liquor.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly, lord,\" said she. And to the town went the maiden. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they conversed together while the maiden was at the town. And behold!\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden came back, and a youth with her, bearing on his back a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "costrel full of good purchased mead, and a quarter of a young bullock.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the hands of the maiden was a quantity of white bread, and she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had some manchet bread in her veil, and she came into the chamber.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not obtain better than this,\" said she, \"nor with better\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should I have been trusted.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is good enough,\" said Geraint. And they caused the meat to be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "boiled; and when their food was ready, they sat down. And it was on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "this wise: Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and his wife, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the maiden served them. And they ate and drank.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the hoary-headed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man; and he asked him, in the first place, to whom belonged the palace\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that he was in.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly,\" said he, \"it was I that built it, and to me also belonged the\r\n",

      "city and the castle which thou sawest.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said Geraint, \"how is it that thou hast lost them now?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I lost a great earldom as well as these,\" said he. \"And this is how\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I lost them. I had a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possessions to myself; and when he came to his strength, he demanded of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "me his property; but I withheld it from him. So he made war upon me,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and wrested from me all that I possessed.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good sir,\" said Geraint, \"wilt thou tell me wherefore came the knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the lady and the dwarf just now into the town, and what is the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "preparation which I saw and the putting of arms in order?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so,\" said he. \"The preparations are for the game that is to\r\n",

      "be held to-morrow by the young earl, which will be on this wise. In the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "midst of a meadow which is here, two forks will be set up, and upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two forks a silver rod, and upon the silver rod a sparrow-hawk; and for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the sparrow-hawk there will be a tournament. And to the tournament will\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go all the array thou didst see in the city, of men and of horses and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of arms. And with each man will go the lady he loves best; and no man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "can joust for the sparrow-hawk, except the lady he loves best be with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him. And the knight that thou sawest has gained the sparrow-hawk these\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two years; and if he gains it the third year, they will from that time\r\n",
      "\n",
      "send it every year to him, and he himself will come here no more. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he will be called the Knight of the Sparrow-hawk from that time forth.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Geraint, \"what is thy counsel to me concerning this knight,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "on account of the insult which I received from the dwarf, and that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "which was received by the maiden of Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint told the hoary-headed man what the insult was that he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as thou hast neither dame nor\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden belonging to thee for whom thou canst joust. Yet I have arms\r\n",
      "\n",
      "here which thou couldest have, and there is my horse also, if he seem\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to thee better than thine own.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, sir,\" said he, \"Heaven reward thee! But my own horse, to which\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I am accustomed, together with thy arms, will suffice. And if, when\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the appointed time shall come to-morrow, thou wilt permit me, sir, to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "challenge for yonder maiden that is thy daughter, I will engage, if I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "escape from the tournament, to love the maiden as long as I live; and,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gladly will I permit thee,\" said the hoary-headed man. \"And since\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou dost thus resolve, it is necessary that thy horse and arms\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should be ready to-morrow at break of day. For then the Knight of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Sparrow-hawk will make proclamation, and ask the lady he loves best to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "take the sparrow-hawk. 'For,' will he say to her, 'thou art the fairest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of women, and thou didst possess it last year and the year previous;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and if any deny it thee to-day, by force will I defend it for thee.'\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore,\" said the hoary-headed man, \"it is needful for thee to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "be there at daybreak; and we three will be with thee.\" And thus was it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "settled.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And at night, lo! they went to sleep. And before the dawn they arose,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and arrayed themselves; and by the time that it was day, they were all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "four in the meadow. And there was the Knight of the Sparrow-hawk making\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the proclamation, and asking his lady-love to fetch the sparrow-hawk.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fetch it not,\" said Geraint, \"for there is here a maiden who is\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fairer, and more noble, and more comely, and who has a better claim to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it, than thou.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If thou maintainest the sparrow-hawk to be due to her, come forward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and do battle with me.\" And Geraint went forward to the top of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "meadow, having upon himself and upon his horse armor which was heavy\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and rusty and worthless, and of uncouth shape. Then they encountered\r\n",
      "\n",
      "each other, and they broke a set of lances, and they broke a second\r\n",
      "\n",
      "set, and a third. And thus they did at every onset, and they broke\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as many lances as were brought to them. And when the earl and his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "company saw the Knight of the Sparrow-hawk gaining the mastery, there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was shouting and joy and mirth amongst them. And the hoary-headed man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and his wife and his daughter were sorrowful. And the hoary-headed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "man served Geraint lances as often as he broke them; and the dwarf\r\n",
      "\n",
      "served the Knight of the Sparrow-hawk. Then the hoary-headed man came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Geraint. \"O chieftain!\" said he, \"since no other will hold with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thee, behold, here is the lance which was in my hand on the day when I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received the honor of knighthood; and from that time to this I never\r\n",
      "\n",
      "broke it. And it has an excellent point.\" Then Geraint took the lance,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thanking the hoary-headed man. And thereupon the dwarf also brought a\r\n",

      "to the boundaries of thy territories; and, if thou hast any trouble\r\n",
      "\n",
      "respecting them, send unto thy companions.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven reward thee!\" said Geraint. \"And this will I do.\" And Geraint\r\n",
      "\n",
      "journeyed to the uttermost part of his dominions. And experienced\r\n",
      "\n",
      "guides, and the chief men of his country, went with him. And the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "furthermost point that they showed him he kept possession of.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur's court, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "frequented tournaments. And he became acquainted with valiant and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mighty men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly\r\n",
      "\n",
      "done elsewhere. And he enriched his court, and his companions, and his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nobles, with the best horses and the best arms, and with the best and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "most valuable jewels; and he ceased not until his fame had flown over\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the face of the whole kingdom. And when he knew that it was thus, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "began to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was worth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his opposing. And he loved his wife, and liked to continue in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "palace, with minstrelsy and diversions. And for a long time he abode\r\n",
      "\n",
      "at home. And he took no delight in any thing besides, insomuch that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gave up the friendship of his nobles, together with his hunting and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his amusements, and lost the hearts of all the host in his court. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the palace, on account of his relinquishing so completely their\r\n",
      "\n",
      "companionship for the love of his wife. And these tidings came to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Erbin. And when Erbin had heard these things, he spoke unto Enid, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "inquired of her whether it was she that had caused Geraint to act thus,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and to forsake his people and his hosts.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I, by my confession unto Heaven!\" said she. \"There is nothing\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more hateful to me than this.\" And she knew not what she should do,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "for, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet was it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint concerning it. And she was very sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And one morning in the summer time, Enid was without sleep in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "apartment which had windows of glass. And the sun shone upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "couch. And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he was asleep. Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "appearance, and she said, \"Alas! and am I the cause that these arms\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike fame which they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "once so richly enjoyed?\" And as she said this, the tears dropped from\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her eyes, and they fell upon his breast. And the tears she shed, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the words she had spoken, awoke him. And another thing contributed to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "awaken him, and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that she spoke thus, but that it was because she loved some other man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more than him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he called his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "squire. And when he came to him, \"Go quickly,\" said he \"and prepare my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse and my arms, and make them ready.--And do thou arise,\" said he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Enid, \"and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be accoutred,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou hast in thy\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possession. And evil betide me,\" said he, \"if thou returnest here until\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so completely as thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "didst say. And if it be so, it will then be easy for thee to seek the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast thinking.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So she arose, and clothed herself in her meanest garments. \"I know\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing, lord,\" said she, \"of thy meaning.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither wilt thou know at this time,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Geraint went to see Erbin. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I am going upon a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "quest, and I am not certain when I may come back. Take heed, therefore,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "unto thy possessions, until my return.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so,\" said he; \"but it is strange to me that thou shouldest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go so suddenly. And who will proceed with thee, since thou art not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "strong enough to traverse the land of Lloegyr alone?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But one person only will go with me.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven counsel thee, my son!\" said Erbin. \"And may many attach\r\n",

      "themselves to thee in Lloegyr!\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then went Geraint to the place where his horse was, and it was equipped\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with foreign armor, heavy and shining. And he desired Enid to mount her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long way before him. \"And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "whatever thou mayest see, and whatever thou mayest hear concerning me,\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said he, \"do thou not turn back. And unless I speak unto thee, say not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou one word, either.\" And they set forward. And he did not choose the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which was the wildest,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and most beset by thieves and robbers, and venomous animals. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "came to a high road, which they followed till they saw a vast forest;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and they went towards it, and they saw four armed horsemen come forth\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from the forest.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "When the horsemen had beheld them, one of them said to the others,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Behold, here is a good occasion for us to capture two horses and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "armor, and a lady likewise; for this we shall have no difficulty in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "doing against yonder single knight, who hangs his head so pensively and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "heavily.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Enid heard this discourse, and she knew not what she should do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "through fear of Geraint, who had told her to be silent. \"The vengeance\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of Heaven be upon me,\" she said, \"if I would not rather receive my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "death from his hand than from the hand of any other! And though he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should slay me, yet will I speak to him, lest I should have the misery\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to witness his death.\" So she waited for Geraint until he came near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to her. \"Lord,\" said she, \"didst thou hear the words of those men\r\n",
      "\n",
      "concerning thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at her angrily. \"Thou hadst\r\n",
      "\n",
      "only,\" said he, \"to hold thy peace as I bade thee. I wish but for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "silence, and not for warning. And though thou shouldest desire to see\r\n",
      "\n",
      "my defeat and my death by the hands of those men, yet do I feel no\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dread.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the foremost of them couched his lance, and rushed upon Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he received him, and that not feebly. But he let the thrust go by\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, while he struck the horseman upon the centre of his shield in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "such a manner that his shield was split, and his armor broken, and so\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that a cubit's length of the shaft of Geraint's lance passed through\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his body, and sent him to the earth the length of the lance over his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse's crupper. Then the second horseman attacked him furiously,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "being wroth at the death of his companion. But with one thrust Geraint\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overthrew him also, and killed him as he had done the other. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "third set upon him, and he killed him in like manner. And thus also he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slew the fourth. Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint dismounted from his horse, and took the arms of the men he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slain, and placed them upon their saddles, and tied together the reins\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of their horses, and he mounted his horse again. \"Behold, what thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "must do,\" said he; \"take the four horses, and drive them before thee,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and proceed forward, as I bade thee just now. And say not one word unto\r\n",
      "\n",
      "me, unless I speak first unto thee. And I declare unto Heaven,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he, \"if thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do, as far as I can, lord,\" said she, \"according to thy desire.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went forward through the forest; and when they left the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "forest, they came to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of thickly tangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld three\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horsemen coming towards them, well equipped with armor, both they and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their horses. Then the maiden looked steadfastly upon them; and when\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they had come near, she heard them say one to another, \"Behold, here\r\n",
      "\n",
      "is a good arrival for us: here are coming for us four horses and four\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suits of armor. We shall easily obtain them, spite of yonder dolorous\r\n",
      "\n",
      "knight, and the maiden also will fall into our power.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is but too true,\" said she to herself; \"for my husband is tired\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with his former combat. The vengeance of Heaven will be upon me unless\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I warn him of this.\" So the maiden waited until Geraint came up to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "her. \"Lord,\" said she, \"dost thou not hear the discourse of yonder men\r\n",
      "\n",
      "concerning thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it?\" asked he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They say to one another, that they will easily obtain all this spoil.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" he answered, \"that their words are less grievous\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to me than that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my counsel.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord,\" said she, \"I feared lest they should surprise thee unawares.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold thy peace, then!\" said he. \"Do not I desire silence?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon one of the horsemen couched his lance, and attacked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint. And he made a thrust at him which he thought would be very\r\n",
      "\n",
      "effective. But Geraint received it carelessly, and struck it aside; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "then he rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre of his person, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from the shock of man and horse the quantity of his armor did not avail\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, and the head of the lance and part of the shaft passed through\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, so that he was carried to the ground an arm and a spear's length\r\n",
      "\n",
      "over the crupper of his horse. And both the other horsemen came forward\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in their turn; but their onset was not more successful than that of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their companion. And the maiden stood by, looking at all this; and on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the one hand she was in trouble lest Geraint should be wounded in his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "encounter with the men, and on the other hand she was joyful to see him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "victorious. Then Geraint dismounted, and bound the three suits of armor\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the three saddles, and he fastened the reins of all the horses\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together, so that he had seven horses with him. And he mounted his own\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse, and commanded the maiden to drive forward the others. \"It is no\r\n",
      "\n",
      "more use for me to speak to thee than to refrain; for thou wilt not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attend to my advice.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so, as far as I am able, lord,\" said she; \"but I cannot\r\n",
      "\n",
      "conceal from thee the fierce and threatening words which I may hear\r\n",
      "\n",
      "against thee, lord, from such strange people as those that haunt this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wilderness.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said he, \"that I desire nought but silence:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore hold thy peace.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, lord, while I can.\" And the maiden went on with the horses\r\n",
      "\n",
      "before her, and she pursued her way straight onwards. And from the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "copse-wood already mentioned they journeyed over a vast and dreary open\r\n",
      "\n",
      "plain. And at a great distance from them they beheld a wood, and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "could see neither end nor boundary to the wood, except on that side\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was nearest to them, and they went towards it. Then there came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "from out the wood five horsemen, eager and bold, and mighty and strong,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mounted upon chargers that were powerful, and large of bone, and high\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mettled, and proudly snorting; and both the men and the horses were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "well equipped with arms. And when they drew near to them, Enid heard\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them say, \"Behold, here is a fine booty coming to us, which we shall\r\n",
      "\n",
      "obtain easily and without labor, for we shall have no trouble in taking\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all those horses and arms, and the lady also, from yonder single knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "so doleful and sad.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she knew not in the world what she should do. At last, however, she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "determined to warn Geraint: so she turned her horse's head towards him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord,\" said she, \"if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder horsemen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it is.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Angrily and bitterly did Geraint smile upon her, and he said, \"Thee do\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear doing every thing that I forbade thee; but it may be that thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wilt repent this yet.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And immediately, behold, the men met them; and victoriously and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gallantly did Geraint overcome them all five. And he placed the five\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suits of armor upon the five saddles, and tied together the reins of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the twelve horses, and gave them in charge to Enid. \"I know not,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he, \"what good it is for me to order thee; but this time I charge thee\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in an especial manner.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping in advance of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much as his wrath\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would permit to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble with the care of the horses. Then they reached the wood, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was both deep and vast; and in the wood night overtook them. \"Ah,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden,\" said he, \"it is vain to attempt proceeding forward!\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, lord,\" said she, \"whatsoever thou wishest, we will do.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be best for us,\" he answered, \"to turn out of the wood, and to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "rest, and wait for the day, in order to pursue our journey.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will we gladly,\" said she. And they did so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Having dismounted himself, he took her down from her horse. \"I cannot\r\n",

      "by any means refrain from sleep, through weariness,\" said he. \"Do thou,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, lord,\" said she. Then he went to sleep in his armor; and thus\r\n",
      "\n",
      "passed the night, which was not long at that season. And when she saw\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the dawn of day appear, she looked around her to see if he were waking,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and thereupon he woke. \"My lord,\" she said, \"I have desired to awake\r\n",

      "\n",

      "and keep straight on before thee, as thou didst yesterday.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And early in the day they left the wood, and they came to an open\r\n",
      "\n",
      "country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a river before them, and the horses bent down, and drank the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "water. And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they met a slender stripling, with a satchel about his neck, and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saw that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was. And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mouth of the pitcher. And the youth saluted Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven prosper thee!\" said Geraint. \"And whence dost thou come?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come,\" said he, \"from the city that lies before thee. My lord,\" he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By no means. Through yonder wood did I come.\"\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"We were in the wood last night.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I warrant,\" said the youth, \"that thy condition there last night was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not the most pleasant, and that thou hadst neither meat nor drink.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, by my faith!\" said he.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilt thou follow my counsel,\" said the youth, \"and take thy meal from\r\n",

      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" said he. \"And Heaven reward thee for it!\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her horse.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they washed, and took their repast. And the youth cut the bread in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "slices, and gave them drink, and served them withal.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they had finished, the youth arose, and said to Geraint, \"My\r\n",

      "the best place that thou knowest, and the most commodious one for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horses, and take thou whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment\r\n",

      "for thy service and thy gift.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "repay services much greater than those I have rendered unto thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And to the town went the youth, and he took the best and the most\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasant lodgings that he knew; and after that he went to the palace,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "having the horse and armor with him, and proceeded to the place where\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the earl was, and told him all his adventure. \"I go now, lord,\" said\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the youth went to meet Geraint, and told him that he would be\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received gladly by the earl in his own palace, but he would go only\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to his lodgings. And he had a goodly chamber, in which was plenty of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "straw, and drapery, and a spacious and commodious place he had for the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horses; and the youth prepared for them plenty of provender.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And after they had disarrayed themselves, Geraint spoke thus to Enid:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" said he, \"to the other side of the chamber, and come not to this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "side of the house; and thou mayest call to thee the woman of the house,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "if thou wilt.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do, lord,\" said she, \"as thou sayest.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereupon the man of the house came to Geraint, and welcomed him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O chieftain!\" he said, \"hast thou taken thy meal?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" said he. Then the youth spoke to him, and inquired if he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would not drink something before he met the earl. \"Truly I will,\" said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So the youth went into the town, and brought them drink. And they drank.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must needs sleep,\" said Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the youth. \"And whilst thou sleepest, I will go to see the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "earl.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go gladly,\" he said, \"and come here again when I require thee.\" And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint went to sleep; and so did Enid also.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the youth came to the place where the earl was, and the earl asked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told him. \"I must\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go,\" said the youth, \"to wait on him in the evening.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" answered the earl, \"and greet him well from me, and tell him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that in the evening I will go to see him.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will I do,\" said the youth. So he came when it was time for them\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to awake. And they arose and went forth. And when it was time for them\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to take their food, they took it. And the youth served them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint inquired of the man of the house whether there were any of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his companions that he wished to invite to him, and he said that there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were. \"Bring them hither, and entertain them at my cost with the best\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou canst buy in the town.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And the man of the house brought there those whom he chose, and feasted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them at Geraint's expense. Thereupon, behold the earl came to visit\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint, and his twelve honorable knights with him. And Geraint rose up\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and welcomed him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven preserve thee!\" said the Earl. Then they all sat down according\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to their precedence in honor. And the earl conversed with Geraint, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "inquired of him the object of his journey.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have none,\" he replied, \"but to seek adventures, and to follow my\r\n",
      "\n",
      "own inclination.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the earl cast his eye upon Enid, and he looked at her steadfastly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And he thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more comely\r\n",
      "\n",
      "than her. So he arose, and took his leave, and went forth with his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attendants. And she told not then to Geraint any of the conversation\r\n",
      "\n",
      "which she had had with the earl, lest it should rouse his anger, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "cause him uneasiness and care.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the usual hour they went to sleep. And at the beginning of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Geraint's armor together, so that it might be ready to put on. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint's bed;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, \"My lord, arise, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "clothe thyself; for these were the words of the earl to me, and his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "intention concerning me.\" So she told Geraint [that the earl was coming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with a troop of followers on the morrow to take her away by force].\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And, although he was wroth with her, he took warning, and clothed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "himself. And she lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave there the candle,\" said he, \"and desire the man of the house to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "come here.\" Then she went, and the man of the house came to him. \"Dost\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou know how much I owe thee?\" asked Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think thou owest but little.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take the eleven horses and the eleven suits of armor.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven reward thee, lord!\" said he. \"But I spent not the value of one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "suit of armor upon thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For that reason,\" said he, \"thou wilt be the richer. And now wilt thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "come to guide me out of the town?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will gladly,\" said he. \"And in which direction dost thou intend to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to leave the town by a different way from that by which I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "entered it.\" So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as far as he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "desired. Then he bade the maiden to go on before him. And she did so,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and went straight forward, and his host returned home. And he had only\r\n",
      "\n",
      "just reached his house, when, behold, the greatest tumult approached\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was ever heard. And when he looked out, he saw fourscore knights\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in complete armor around the house, with the Earl Dwrm at their head.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the knight that was here?\" said the earl.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By thy hand,\" said he, \"he went hence some time ago.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherefore, villain,\" said he, \"didst thou let him go without informing\r\n",

      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My lord, thou didst not command me to do so, else would I not have\r\n",

      "allowed him to depart.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What way dost thou think that he took?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know not, except that he went along the high road.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And they turned their horses' heads that way, and seeing the tracks\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the horses upon the high road, they followed. And when the maiden\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beheld the dawning of the day, she looked behind her, and saw vast\r\n",
      "\n",
      "clouds of dust coming nearer and nearer to her. And thereupon she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "became uneasy, and she thought that it was the earl and his host coming\r\n",
      "\n",
      "after them. And thereupon she beheld a knight appearing through the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mist. \"By my faith!\" said she, \"though he should slay me, it were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "better for me to receive my death at his hands than to see him killed\r\n",
      "\n",
      "without warning him.--My lord,\" she said to him, \"seest thou yonder man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hastening after thee, and many others with him?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do see him,\" said he; \"and, in despite of all my orders, I see that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou wilt never keep silence.\" Then he turned upon the knight, and with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the first thrust he threw him down under his horse's feet. And as long\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as there remained one of the fourscore knights, he overthrew every one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of them at the first onset. And from the weakest to the strongest, they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all attacked him one after the other, except the earl. And last of all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the earl came against him also. And he broke his lance, and then he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "broke a second. But Geraint turned upon him, and struck him with his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "lance upon the centre of his shield, so that by that single thrust the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shield was split, and all his armor broken, and he himself was brought\r\n",
      "\n",
      "over his horse's crupper to the ground, and was in peril of his life.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint drew near to him; and at the noise of the trampling of his\r\n",

      "horse the earl revived.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint granted him mercy. But through the hardness of the ground\r\n",
      "\n",
      "where they had fallen, and the violence of the stroke which they had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "received, there was not a single knight amongst them that escaped\r\n",
      "\n",
      "without receiving a fall mortally severe, and grievously painful, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "desperately wounding, from the hand of Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint journeyed along the high road that was before him, and the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden went on first; and near them they beheld a valley, which was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the fairest ever seen, and which had a large river running through it;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and there was a bridge over the river, and the high road led to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "bridge. And above the bridge, upon the opposite side of the river, they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beheld a fortified town, the fairest ever seen. And as they approached\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the bridge, Geraint saw coming towards him from a thick copse a man\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mounted upon a large and lofty steed, even of pace, and spirited,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "though tractable. \"Ah, knight!\" said Geraint, \"whence comest thou?\"\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I come,\" said he, \"from the valley below us.\"\r\n",

      "\n",
      "ridgy. And as he journeyed thus, he beheld a knight following him upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a war-horse strong and large and proudly-stepping and wide-hoofed and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "broad-chested. And he never saw a man of smaller stature than he who\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had overtaken Geraint, he said to him, \"Tell me, chieftain,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "immediately they charged one another. And a squire of his came to\r\n",

      "hard and severe strokes, that their shields lost all their color. But\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it was very difficult for Geraint to fight with him on account of his\r\n",

      "\n",
      "the efforts he could make. And they fought thus until their horses were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "brought down upon their knees. And at length Geraint threw the knight\r\n",
      "\n",
      "headlong to the ground; and then they fought on foot, and they gave one\r\n",
      "\n",
      "another blows so boldly fierce, so frequent, and so severely powerful,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that their helmets were pierced, and their skullcaps were broken, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their arms were shattered, and the light of their eyes was darkened\r\n",

      "to him all his strength. And boldly angry, and swiftly resolute, and\r\n",
      "\n",

      "to speak to him. So he sent him to apprise Arthur that Geraint was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there wounded, and that he would not go to visit him, and that it was\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And he caused his tent to be removed unto the side of the road. And the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will I not, I declare to Heaven!\" said he. Then he caused a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "maiden to be sent for to conduct Enid to the tent where Gwenhwyvar's\r\n",
      "\n",
      "chamber was. And Gwenhwyvar and all her women were joyful at her\r\n",
      "\n",
      "coming; and they took off her riding-dress, and placed other garments\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon her. Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and ordered him to pitch a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "tent for Geraint and the physicians; and he enjoined him to provide him\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with abundance of all that might be requisite for him. And Kadyrieith\r\n",
      "\n",
      "did as he had commanded him. And Morgan Tud and his disciples were\r\n",
      "\n",
      "brought to Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst Geraint\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was being healed. And when he was fully recovered, Geraint came to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true, lord,\" said Morgan Tud. So the next day Arthur permitted\r\n",

      "him to go forth, and he pursued his journey. And on the same day Arthur\r\n",
      "\n",
      "removed thence.\r\n",

      "formerly done. And she went forward along the high road. And as they\r\n",

      "journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them.\r\n",

      "Geraint would never return. Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "overtook them. And each of them was greater of stature than three other\r\n",
      "\n",
      "men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of each. Then he rushed upon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "one of them, and thrust his lance through his body. And having drawn\r\n",
      "\n",
      "it forth again, he pierced another of them through likewise. But the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "third turned upon him, and struck him with his club; so that he split\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his shield, and crushed his shoulder, and opened his wounds anew, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all his blood began to flow from him. But Geraint drew his sword, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attacked the giant, and gave him a blow on the crown of his head so\r\n",
      "\n",
      "severe and fierce and violent, that his head and his neck were split\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down to his shoulders, and he fell dead. So Geraint left him thus, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "returned to Enid. And when he saw her, he fell down lifeless from his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse. Piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And she came and stood over him where he had fallen. And at the sound\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of her cries came the Earl of Limours, and the host that journeyed with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him, whom her lamentations brought out of their road. And the earl said\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to Enid, \"Alas, lady! what hath befallen thee?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, good sir!\" said she, \"the only man I have loved, or ever shall\r\n",

      "love, is slain.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "his blood flowing excessively. But it appears to me that he did not\r\n",
      "\n",
      "leave the giants without killing some of them, if not all.\" The earl\r\n",
      "\n",
      "caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he thought that there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if he yet would live,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "he had him carried with him in the hollow of his shield, and upon a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "bier. And the two damsels went to the court; and when they arrived\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there, Geraint was placed upon a litter-couch in front of the table\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that was in the hall. Then they all took off their travelling-gear,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and the earl besought Enid to do the same, and to clothe her self in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "other garments.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise,\" said she.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will act towards thee in such wise, that thou needest not be\r\n",

      "sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die. Behold, a good earldom,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "together with myself, will I bestow on thee. Be therefore happy and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "joyful.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said she, \"that henceforth I shall never be\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, by Heaven, I will not,\" she answered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, by Heaven, thou shalt,\" said he. So he took her with him to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "table, against her will, and many times desired her to eat.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I call Heaven to witness,\" said she, \"that I will not eat until the\r\n",

      "man that is upon yonder bier shall eat likewise.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thou canst not fulfil that,\" said the earl. \"Yonder man is dead\r\n",

      "already.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will prove that I can,\" said she.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he offered her a goblet of liquor. \"Drink this goblet,\" he said,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Truly,\" said the earl, \"it is of no more avail for me to be gentle\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with thee than ungentle.\" And he gave her a box in the ear. Thereupon\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she raised a loud and piercing shriek; and her lamentations were much\r\n",
      "\n",
      "greater than they had been before, for she considered in her mind,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that, had Geraint been alive, he durst not have struck her thus.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "But behold, at the sound of her cry, Geraint revived from his swoon,\r\n",

      "and he sat up on the bier, and, finding his sword in the hollow of his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shield, he rushed to the place where the earl was, and struck him a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting blow upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "crown of his head, so that he clove him in twain, until his sword was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed by the table. Then all left the board, and fled away. And this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them. And Geraint looked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes: one was to see that Enid\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had lost her color and her wonted aspect; and the other, to know that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she was in the right. \"Lady,\" said he, \"knowest thou where our horses\r\n",
      "\n",
      "are?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, lord, where thy horse is,\" she replied; \"but I know not where\r\n",
      "\n",
      "is the other. Thy horse is in the house yonder.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "So he went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mounted him,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and took up Enid from the ground, and placed her upon the horse with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "him. And he rode forward. And their road lay between two hedges. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the night was gaining on the day. And lo! they saw behind them the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shafts of spears betwixt them and the sky, and they heard the trampling\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of horses and the noise of a host approaching. \"I hear something\r\n",
      "\n",
      "following us,\" said he, \"and I will put thee on the other side of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the hedge.\" And thus he did. And thereupon, behold, a knight pricked\r\n",
      "\n",
      "towards him, and couched his lance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, \"O chieftain! whoever thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Heaven!\" said he, \"is it Geraint?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, in truth,\" said she. \"And who art thou?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Little King,\" he answered, \"coming to thy assistance; for I\r\n",
      "\n",
      "heard that thou wast in trouble. And if thou hadst followed my advice,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "none of these hardships would have befallen thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing can happen,\" said Geraint, \"without the will of Heaven, though\r\n",
      "\n",
      "much good results from counsel.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the Little King; \"and I know good counsel for thee now.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Come with me to the court of a son-in-law of my sister, which is near\r\n",
      "\n",
      "here, and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so gladly,\" said Geraint. And Enid was placed upon the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse of one of the Little King's squires, and they went forward to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the baron's palace. And they were received there with gladness, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they met with hospitality and attention. And the next morning they went\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to seek physicians, and it was not long before they came; and they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "attended Geraint until he was perfectly well. And while Geraint was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "under medical care, the Little King caused his armor to be repaired,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "until it was as good as it had ever been. And they remained there a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fortnight and a month.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Little King said to Geraint, \"Now will we go towards my own\r\n",
      "\n",
      "court, to take rest and amuse ourselves.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" said Geraint. \"We will first journey for one day more, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "return again.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all my heart!\" said the Little King. \"Do thou go then.\" And early\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in the day they set forth. And more gladly and more joyfully did Enid\r\n",
      "\n",
      "journey with them that day than she had ever done. And they came to the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "main road. And when they reached a place where the road divided in two,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they beheld a man on foot coming towards them along one of these roads;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and Gwiffert asked the man whence he came.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come,\" said he, \"from an errand in the country.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" said Geraint: \"which is the best for me to follow of these\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two roads?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the best for thee to follow,\" answered he; \"for if thou goest\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by this one, thou wilt never return. Below us,\" said he, \"there is a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hedge of mist, and within it are enchanted games; and no one who has\r\n",
      "\n",
      "gone there has ever returned. And the court of the Earl Owain is there,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and he permits no one to go to lodge in the town, except he will go to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "his court.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to Heaven,\" said Geraint, \"that we will take the lower\r\n",
      "\n",
      "road.\" And they went along it until they came to the town. And they\r\n",
      "\n",
      "took the fairest and pleasantest place in the town for their lodging.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And while they were thus, behold, a young man came to them, and greeted\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them. \"Heaven be propitious to thee!\" said they.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good sirs,\" said he, \"what preparations are you making here?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are taking up our lodging,\" said they, \"to pass the night.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not the custom with him who owns the town,\" he answered, \"to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "permit any of gentle birth, unless they come to stay in his court, to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "abide here therefore: come ye to the court.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will come gladly,\" said Geraint. And they went with the page, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they were joyfully received. And the earl came to the hall to meet\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them, and he commanded the tables to be laid. And they washed, and sat\r\n",
      "\n",
      "down. And this is the order in which they sat: Geraint on one side of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the earl, and Enid on the other side, and next to Enid the Little King,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and then the countess next to Geraint; and all after that as became\r\n",
      "\n",
      "their rank. Then Geraint recollected the games, and thought that he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "should not go to them; and on that account he did not eat. Then the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "earl looked upon Geraint, and considered; and he bethought him that his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not eating was because of the games, and it grieved him that he had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "ever established those games, were it only on account of losing such a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "youth as Geraint. And if Geraint had asked him to abolish the games, he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "would gladly have done so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the earl said to Geraint, \"What thought occupies thy mind, that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "thou dost not eat? If thou hesitatest about going to the games, thou\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shalt not go, and no other of thy rank shall ever go, either.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven reward thee!\" said Geraint. \"But I wish nothing better than to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "go to the games, and to be shown the way thither.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that is what thou dost prefer, thou shalt obtain it willingly.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do prefer it, indeed,\" said he. Then they ate, and they were amply\r\n",
      "\n",
      "served, and they had a variety of gifts, and abundance of liquor. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "when they had finished eating they arose. And Geraint called for his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "horse and his armor, and he accoutred both himself and his horse. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all the hosts went forth until they came to the side of the hedge; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the hedge was so lofty, that it reached as high as they could see in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the air; and upon every stake in the hedge, except two, there was the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "head of a man, and the number of stakes throughout the hedge was very\r\n",
      "\n",
      "great.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then said the Little King, \"May no one go in with the chieftain?\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one may,\" said Earl Owain.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which way can I enter?\" inquired Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know not,\" said Owain. \"But enter by the way that thou wilt, and\r\n",

      "that seemeth easiest to thee.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then fearlessly and unhesitatingly Geraint dashed forward into the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mist. And on leaving the mist he came to a large orchard; and in the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "orchard he saw an open space, wherein was a tent of red satin. And\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the door of the tent was open, and an apple-tree stood in front of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the door of the tent; and on a branch of the apple-tree hung a huge\r\n",
      "\n",
      "hunting-horn. Then he dismounted, and went into the tent; and there\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was no one in the tent save one maiden sitting in a golden chair, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "another chair was opposite to her, empty. And Geraint went to the empty\r\n",
      "\n",
      "chair, and sat down therein.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, chieftain!\" said the maiden, \"I would not counsel thee to sit in\r\n",

      "that chair.\"\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherefore?\" said Geraint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man to whom that chair belongs has never suffered another to sit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I care not,\" said Geraint, \"though it displease him that I sit in\r\n",

      "the chair.\" And thereupon they heard a mighty tumult around the tent.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "And Geraint looked to see what was the cause of the tumult. And he\r\n",
      "\n",
      "beheld without a knight mounted upon a war-horse, proudly snorting,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "high-mettled, and large of bone; and a robe of honor in two parts was\r\n",
      "\n",
