Aura agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Zanotti, including its employees, agents and affiliates, harmless from and against any and all  payments, damages, demands, claims, losses, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities (including reasonable attorney\\'s fees and costs), which  arise out of, result from or are related to the breach by Aura of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.  Either party seeking indemnification under this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give notice to the party required to provide  indemnification hereunder (the \"Indemnifying Party\") promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which  indemnity may be sought hereunder, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) to  assume the defense of any claim or litigation resulting thereform; provided that: (i) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the  defense of such claim or litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party may participate in such  defense, but only at the Indemnified Party\\'s own cost and expense; and (iii) the omission by the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided  herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that such omissions results in a  failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party is damaged as a result of such failure to give notice. The  Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or administration order or enter  into any settlement that (i) could affect the intellectual property rights or other business interests of the Indemnified Party or (ii) does not include  as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release form all liability with respect to such  claim or litigation.  In the event that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably and in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense of any claim subject  to indemnification hereunder or any proposed settlement of any such claim by these Indemnifying Party might be expected to affect adversely the  Indemnified Party\\'s intellectual property rights or ability to conduct future business, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take  over and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or lawsuit relating to any such claim at the sole cost and expense of the  Indemnifying Party.  In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of any matter as provided herein, the Indemnified Party shall have  the full right to defend against any such claim or demand, and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such claim or demand, in its sole  discretion.  The provisions of this Section 8.17 shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement.    8.18 Insurance.

All such insurance  coverages shall be occurrence based and not claims made.
