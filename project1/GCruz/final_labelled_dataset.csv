"Although the movie is not that good, the game is actually very entertaining! There is violence, especially with the machine guns, but no blood shown. For a game that is based on a terrible movie, it is pretty fun!",0
"I am disappointed that there are guns and shooting in this game. I told my mom to buy this for my son for the holidays because he likes cars and I was looking for a racing game for him. He instantly loved the racing part, but after a couple of rounds the races became violent with him activating bombs and machine guns and shooting down and blowing up other cars. I was so mad! I have tried very hard to monitor in what way my kids are exposed to guns and violence so that we can discuss it properly, and I was caught off guard with this one. I guess I didn't dig deep enough before making the assumption that Disney would be appropriate for my 7 year old.
On the other hand, he is absolutely in love with the game and is having a blast playing it...I just wish I could feel as good about him playing it. Of course it opened discussion about guns and violence and cartoon violence versus real world violence, but he is 7 for crying out loud...why are we having to have this conversation...kids are growing up too fast these days...and the media isn't helping us shield our children from the very real violence of our world.",0
My children and I have had a great deal of fun playing this together. It has a surprisingly solid co-op mission system with well designed boss battles.,1
"although this game is fun and entertaining, the fact that we have to buy gold coins to continue to play is a rip off. My son, whom is 8 years old is frustrated because he can't progress forward in the game without getting gold, which costs money, real money not play money.",1
"Recently, I got the directions cut version of this on the WII U and it is violent! 1. You can kill anyone you see and any gruesome way you want. 2. Prostitutes are shown in brothels. 3. Drugs are discussed causally and a the start a man is smoking weed.
Overall, not at all appropriate for kids and infants.",0
"I don't think this game is that bad for kids, the violence is there but not as violent as other games, you can shoot any person but it will have a bad consequence for your character. I played this using stealth all the game and also the game gives you the option of not killing guards but to leave them unconscious, it is a great game but it all depends on how you play it, how bad it will bee for your kid. You can take decisions that will make people die or lie in your own benefit but you can always do the right thing. It's all about choice.",0
"This game is for a mature audience. But not just because of the violence, language, and innuendo. The game contains several themes (globalization, trans humanism, greed, etc) that are too complex for kids. Nonetheless, get this game. Parents, know that Adam can take down enemies non-lethally.",0
"The most ambitious and compelling game I have ever played, and I think everyone mature enough to play it despite the mature content should witness a virtual world pretending to be just a game.",1
"Great game. Violence, but game doesn't dwell on it, some swearing but NO sex",0
"This game isn't as inappropriate as the esrb or commonsense media say. The sex is nothing, with the worst thing walking into a brothel for certain missions. The language is not often there, and is only bad occasionally. The drinking is discouraged, and has absolutely no perks, so its not bad. The only thing is that when you choose to use violence, it has some blood. You can also use you augmentations to kill people, making it more close up. Still, its really not that bad, with just as much blood as some T games like ghost recon. Thats why i think anyone 12 and up is fine with this game.",0
"This game is on the milder side among M rated games. Although common sense media exaggerates everything, this game is not that bad. There is no forces violence, and when violence is chosen, its quick and nothing gruesome or all that bloody about it. Also, its easy to die in this game, so its not likely that violence will be chosen anyways. Like all other reviewers on this site, I agree that there is absolutely nothing to be worried about sex wise. Theres no nudity, no sex, and the worst thing you can do is talk to a prostitute and have her compliment your augmentations, which are basically machine transplants that make you superhuman. The drinking is discouraged, so thats not a problem. The only potential thing is language, and while when they use it, its fairly strong, with a couple of f***s and s***s and some other weaker things like b****** and b****. But hte thing is, is that its not used often at all! Really, I think that anyone 13 an dup would be fine with this game.",0
"This game is appropriate for kids 13 and up. The only real reasons that there would be any worry about kidss younger than that is the violence and language. The violence is only a problem for really young kids, like 7 or 8, where they might not realize that violence is bad. Its not really a problem for kids older than that because you don't have to use violence and its usually encouraged that you don't. I think the language could be a problem for people younger than 13 because while they probably hear and use worse language, the use of it in video games just reinforces it even more. I think thought that at 13, kids really don't think anything in video games should affect the way you act. The only thing I really don't think is a problem is the sexual content. It says that its there, but even if a kid did think that video games could be taken as real life, there wouldn't be anything to desensitizr them. Great game for teenagers",0
"This game has many different things that could be considered inappropriate, but in milder ways than other games. For example, it has violence, but it doesnt even have to be ussed. It also has language, but its only used by enemies, in battle, meaning your not even paying attention to it. It has drinking, but it just makes the game harder, encouraging not to do it. Its also rated M for sexual content, but there really is none so it doesnt matter. all in all good for 12 and up",0
"This game is very interesting, because it does not require that the player uses any violence. Even when the player does choose to use violence, like in most games, there is blood, but its really just a quick spray that is there is then's gone two seconds later. There is also some language, and if your kid is below 13, it's inappropriate. But honestly, teenagers hear worse from others,and probably say worse in one hour than you do in the entire game. There are also drugs and drinking, but personally, i don't believe that that sort of stuff affects children. An d even f it did, then there would be very few drug addicts out there because of all those ""above the influence commercials"" all in all, a very good game appropriate for 13 year olds and up",0
"Playing this game, I wished several times that there was an option to turn off some of the swearing, since it felt unnecessary. The game can be played non-violently, and when done that way, there are ample opportunities for you as a player to make choices about how your character will handle both conversations and potential fighting situations.
I think that some of the philosophic issues raised in the game can make for good discussion, but that would require your kids to be interested in examining and discussing how different sets of morals and ideals can both seem valid, but also clash with one another.
Since there's no option to turn off blood or ease off on the language, I think the M rating is appropriate if you're not interested in watching or discussing the game with your kid. If you do like to talk about games with your kid, and enjoy a decent story in your games, you could go a few years younger, down to 14-15; in that case though, I'd say make sure to play the game yourself so you're familiar with the story enough to ask questions about how things are going.",0
Really great game with levels that excite and are awsome. Some bloody bits with some attacks.,1
"Extreme bloody sci-fi game only for adults.
Extreme Violence
Strong language(f--ker,sh-y,f--k,)",0
"This was a great game, I had the content filter on and it was very playable although there is still some questionable language for kids. This game might be ok for 15 and over but only under strict parental supervision to make sure the filter is on.",0
"Blood Comes out, Bad Words screaming out of the way, guns blazing.. First of, this is innapopriate for kids under 13, Its a third person shooter, Graphicly Intense, Amazing story... But I don't reccomend this for 13 and under... I don't even let my 9 year old son touch this game nor my 11 year old son too...",0
"War, Drugs, Alien Hordes, Mass Murder of different species. Compared to call of duty a DEVIL game",0
"gears 3 is better than the first two, mainly because the campaign is longer than last time and it has even more insane action and extreme gore than the first two, and also, the big set piece shootout at the hotel at the end set the record for the longest and bloodiest shootout ever, hahahahaha, it lasted for an hour for cryin out loud. BRING ON GEARS 4!!!!!!",0
"Effective use of an aging engine, upgraded to bring the 360 to it's knees. Plays as smooth as butter.",1
"After playing the game from start to finish, I would have to say with my honest opinion that the game was absolutely incredible. Though very bloody and gory, just like the two before, Gears Of War 3 comes through and makes it's own name for itself with a fantastic story, brilliant characters and gameplay to match. I do recommend though that parents check out the game first if any of their children, 15 and under, want to play.",0
"I guess it really depends on who your kids are. Yeah, you can turn off the blood and gore but do your kids aren't dumb. They know a chainsaw would really decapitate a person. And don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of the series and its innovative storyline, as well as smart mouth characters like Baird. But if you want to get this for your kids, turn off the strong language and gore when you go to the options menu. Caution, if you have rowdy kids that like fight or throw tantrums don't get it. Lol, it will only make them worse. Otherwise if your kids are well behaved and they aren't easily influenced, than shoot for the moon. But like I said in the title, theres a reason why they say the game is rated for a MATURE audience. Forget the age, it maybe cgi, but it looks real enough that it just might turn your stomach if your not used to seeing gorey movies/games.",0
"Gears of War 3 is a very enjoyable game to play, that is if you are either old enough to purchase it or you are mature enough to handle the amount of violent content. Looking at some other reviews, I noticed that the Lancer chainsaw is mentioned frequently, but having played this game for a good amount of time there are a few other methods of executing characters that may be of interest to parents. Just to name a few other more extreme methods, there is a move were you rip off another player's arm and then beat them with it while blood is flying everywhere. Two other ways involve a bladed bow or gigantic meatcleaver to decapitate another person's head off. Finally, there is an execution were you jam a flamethrower into the enemy's stomach and then cook them from the inside out, while they are screaming from the incineration. Outside of the executions, the shotgun can turn players into chunks of meat if shot at too closely. There is quite a bit of strong language as well. I would say older teens would be fine, but I wouldn't buy or even play this game in front of younger children. As for adults, it is a very enjoyable game, with lots of replay value across the four modes of play. One of the best games I have played in a long time. I would recommend it over both Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3 as far as shooters go, especially when online as the Gears community is, in general, more mature and not quite as profane as the other two games' communities.",0
"Gears of War 3 is a great sci-fi action shooter with amazing graphics, yet the violence is extreme and brutal. You use machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles and other explosive devices to kill and dismember the hideous looking alien species, known as the Locusts, with bloody and gory results. You also use a chainsaw on your gun to gorily dispatch your foes at close range and blood graphically spurts on the camera. The profanity is frequent and strong, constant use of f**k, motherf**ker, s**t, and other crude remarks. The intense apocalyptic-like atmosphere which shows other soldiers fighting off the locusts really sets the violent tone in this game. AT LEAST for people 17 and up.",0
The game is definitely not for kids. I tested the game at E3 and found that there is a part in the game where you can play the demonic alien creatures and kill humans. I find that a bit dark for some 8 year old to play. I think it says something about our culture; we really are surrounding ourselves with some really dark stuff.,0
"Kirby Mass Attack is an action-adventure game with lots of very vague cartoony violence. Your team of little Kirbys (smily pink puffballs) pile on their enemies and battle them, though the actual fighting is depicted as nothing more than a whirring of arms and feet. Defeated Kirbys turn into ghost/angels and begin to float away, but they can be grabbed and brought ""back to life."" There is some strategy involved in deciding how to use your many Kirbys, and the game encourages experimenting. Recommended for ages 3-8 years",1
in this kirby game there is no sucking up enemies still fun game and i recommend it,1
"I've played this a few times by myself and with close friends. I really enjoy it and there are obviously things that you and your kid could talk about such as teamwork and good sportsmanship when you lose (controlling your temper). You can also play together. I've never tried any online modes so I can't speak as to the security of that part of the game. One great thing about it is that there is a manager mode (if that's something that interests your kid) where you can be in control of how the money is spent, what players to buy and sell, and what players play in each game.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to tell you about Skyrim, what it is, what it is about, and the different themes associated with it.
Skyrim is the next installment of Bethesda Softwork's award-winning Role Playing Game series, The Elder Scrolls. It is a game in which a person takes control of a character of their own design (anything from brave Nordic warrior to Cat-Person.) One traverses the open world of Skyrim in search of fame and glory through combat, trade, errands, and diplomacy. I feel that ""pause for 13"" is a worthy rating for this game, as while many 13 year-olds can certainly handle many of the game's mature themes, it is not always a given.
Let us look through the stuff here, shall we?
Educational:
Believe it or not dear reader, this game can actually teach a player a good deal about conserving money and bartering, as in the game the character can make many decisions about what to buy, where, and for what reason. This is helped as different stores and vendors offer things at different prices. The player's vocabulary of fantastical words will also be increased, as they will learn words like ""tome"" or ""necromancy"". Not that they are particularly useful words or anything.
Role models: The main role-model in the game, is actually the player themselves. They can decide to, ultimately, if they want to smash in the head of an innocent civilian or not. As most games, combat against other blood-thirsty warriors and great beasts is required to play and win the game, but it is up to the player if they want to be a paragon of righteousness and help the weak, or be a really, really big jerk.
Violence: The game almost revolves around violence, but not as much as a game like Call of Duty. The player can choose several different methods of battle to defeat a foe, everything from giant-axe brutality to spewing a torrent of fire out of their hands. As could be expected, the goal of all methods is to kill one's opponent, but magic I have seen is notably less bloody than melee combat. Players can expect to see corpses, skeletons, and mutilated bodies throughout the course of the entire game.
Sexual themes: Minimal but still present. The occasional bit of innuendo here, some cleavage. Characters can appear with most clothing off, this being men in loincloth and girls in their undies.
Language: Not as bad as most games. No F-bombs or swearing in ""the name,"" as it takes place in another world entirely. The ""D"" word and the ""B"" word are common place however. Basically any swear that can sound alright said in medieval times.
Themes: It can get pretty strong in this game. Many a time will the player be forced into hard, morally difficult or confusing situations. There is, if the player decides to peruse some schools of magic, a good deal of summoning, the collection of the souls of enemies, and other dark ideas in general.
Addictive factor: Skyrim is an incredible game. It is almost endlessly immersive, and can hold a person's attention for months, literally. There is so much to do and see in the game that there are some people who have played a single character for hundreds of hours in the previous game, Oblivion, just to enjoy all that there is to offer. It goes without saying that Skyrim has even more content, and can utterly consume the life of the player if they have nothing else to do. Be sure your child is not overly-imaginative in the way that they would blur fantasy and reality together, as this is one of those games.
Overall: Skyrim is an excellent game for anyone who can take the mature themes and still enjoy them, along with playing it in moderation. If not, it could lead to an escapist attitude toward life in general, as the player would much rather play Skyrim than enjoy the charms of reality. Be sure to know your child if you allow them to play it.",0
"Some of these reviews are obviously made by parents that just kind of glanced at it while the kid played, so here's one from someone who has spent over 120 hours playing it. This game is probably something I'd even play around kids, but not something I'd let them play by themselves until they got a little older depending on their curiosity level. The reason why being exactly how immersive this game truly is. I've been playing this game since it came out back in 2011 (it is currently 2019 while I make this post) and I have still not seen everything there is to see in the game. Now, that makes for a terrific game, but it also makes it very difficult to put a real rating on it. You are never confident that the kids will not find something that is truly not for the eyes of children. The main story line, which is something kids are likely to stick on, has violence and smash talk, and that is it. The violence is unrealistic (you see blood, but it...just play the game, you'll see what I mean) and mostly directed towards creatures that are considered evil and you find main characters slaying in children's fairy tails - skeletons, dragons, ghosts, vampires, etc. However, two of the guilds have frequent killing of actual playable races and your character is also kind of forced to choose a side in the civil war (insert more smash talk). These people are also considered evil. Everything else, you have to seriously look for.
Sexual content: getting married, there is none. Playing the game, there is none. Curiously running around all the holds and collecting books for your library, however, and you can pick up books that have erotic literature. The most well known of these being the book ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"". So like I said, depending on how curious your child is and how likely they are to truly look around and immerse themselves in the lore, this game might not be for them.
The swearing in the game is pretty much just lore. They don't say the F bomb, but are likely to call other races names because of the blatant racism. These names are all kid friendly, like ""cat"" and ""lizard"". You might get the S word of the D word every once in a while, but they are few and far between, and let's be honest...you can talk to your kid about language a lot easier than some other things we'd like to shelter them from.
The drug in the game is skooma. Unless they really looked into the lore, they're not likely to even understand it's anything but juice. The previous games in the elder scrolls series is actually what made me know that skooma was an illegal drug, because the previous games are much more obvious about it. Skyrim, however, is not. You just kind of find it and somewhere along the line hear ""maybe don't try to sell that stuff"". End of drugs. The alcohol is a lot more prevalent. You can walk into breweries, pick up ale, etc. There is one quest where you get drunk and had a wild night, but everything is just kind of hinted and you don't actually witness anything bad.
I hope this makes it easier to decide. I would've been able to play this game at 8 years old and never even come close to seeing any of the things I mentioned today. Mostly because 8 year olds don't realize they can run away from the main story line and play side stuff. It's likely to go straight over their heads. But for some kids who are a little more mature and curious? Perhaps wait until they're in high school.",0
"I am 17 years old, and I have been playing skyrim for about a year now. It is by far one of my favorite games, and perhaps Bethesda's greatest work yet. It has tons of quests and story lines that change your game completely, your every action affecting your outcomes. That being said, I do not find it appropriate for children or even young teens. While some gameplay can be safe for a younger audience to watch, there are many quests that can warp a child or young teen. You may not see this in the beginning of the game, or even in the first 10 or so hours. Draugrs, for example, may frighten children under 12. They are like walking mummies in the movies, only more graphic. Dark brotherhood quests can be extremely disturbing, and could honestly bother some 15 or 16 year olds. It is rather violent, given the fact that you can kill just about anyone in the game, and there are many you must kill. The game may seem okay when for younger gamers when you're just above ground, killing wolves, but when you start exploring tombs, keeps, and other complex quests, there is too much content that is not at all appropriate. There are entire quests centered on necromancy, or raising the dead, for example. These types of quests make up the entire game, so please consider that. Also, there is torture in the game. The dark brotherhood has their very own torture chamber, complete with torture victims. I believe there are other quests with torture, but I have not gotten to those yet, as there are hundreds of quests. The language is very mild, but there is some. That is up to the decision of the parents on how appropriate the language is. There is some drinking, but no more than what is seen in real life. Each town has a drunk or two. There is a drug, skooma, which your character can become addicted to. It is sold by khajiits, taken from bandits, prisoners, ect. Skooma is also illegal in skyrim, so it represents real drugs. There are a couple of references to bondage and some scantily clad women, but there is not too much obvious sexual content. There is one mission in riften where the dragonborn must find a woman's married sexual partners and confront her about them. In the quest, you can find a note labeled ""until next time"" vaguely and laughably describing one of her encounters. You can also find a book by her bedside called ""the lusty argonian maid"" which is sarcastic and most children would not understand it. I do not find this game at all suitable for children 14 and under. If your child is under 11, I would not suggest allowing them to see you, or their older siblings, playing this game. Ages of 15 and 16 are arguable, and parents should carefully decide whether their child is mature enough for it at those ages. Also, if your teen has a violent nature, you may want to bring that into consideration. It is rated M for a good reason, and while it may seem innocent at first, there are far too many things that can be seen in the hundreds of hours of gameplay that are not for kids. However, for older teens, given they are mature, it can help to increase decision making skills. Many of the events are references to actual historical events and people. It may help to bring a better understanding of history and society. Be careful if your teen is easily immersed, because even I find myself wanting to press a button to collect a flower or mushroom, or holding up my ""magic"" if I get startled. It is very easy to get lost in skyrim, feeling like it is reality. Overall Skyrim is an amazing game, but please wait until your child is 15 before even considering it for them. Again, some content in skyrim is fine, but there are a lot of quests that would be terrible for a child to stumble upon. If you aren't willing to go through at least 50 hours of gameplay to figure this out, please do not ignore the rating system and reviews of people who have played much of the game. And do not listen to reviews of kids who should not even been playing this game. Most of them haven't played enough to know all of the content.",0
"I find a lot of the other reviewers have inaccurate reviews with things written that aren't very true. This is the best game I have ever played and I think people need to play this but need accurate info about it first.................
Sex-First of all I have never seen any nudity or sex depicted and can't think of one time when there was even a reference to sex. You can get married in the game. Also I know that if the game is being played on a PC there are mods available that make NPCs nude but that would have to be sought out then installed to actually see. Overall sex and nudity is a 0/10.....................
Drugs/ Alcohol- the use of drugs and alcohol is very minimal. I've ran into a skooma dealer twice in my 650+ hrs of gameplay. Also there is one quest where you can go into a cabin in the woods and see people under the influence of it. Also there is wine or mead or ale for sale at some places but the only quest where you can actually get drunk is where you have a drinking contest. Overall anything involving drugs or alcohol is such a minimal part of the game that it is barely noticeable. 2/10 at worst................
Swearing - swearing is barely noticeable as there is only about 3 swear words through the entire game and even then it's only words like d*mn, sh*t, and b*tch instead of c**t, c**k, or f**k.....................
Magic/occult/gods - there is extensive use of magic in skyrim and it would be hard to do anything in skyrim without seeing one of these things. On the other side of this you don't have to use magic yourself and don't have to become a vampire or a werewolf. You could also play the game as a good Mage or a person that fights evil creatures and makes the world better. There are many quest that involve magic or occult but many are avoidable. Overall this category is 8/10 this category only really matters to religious people though or people that want to avoid these type of things................
Violence - violence is unavoidable in almost every quest although most of the time you can chose to only do quest where you kill monsters and animals not humans. Also blood can be turned off in the settings or less violent methods can be used in the game such as ice spells instead of swords and ""shouts"" (Fus Ro Dah) (Yol) instead of bows. Overall Violence is 7/10 normally and 3or4/10 if you avoid killing humans and use less violent methods..................
Morals- this is where it gets difficult. Depending on the path you choose the morals could be a good influence or a bad. For example you could join the dawnguard and keep the world free from vampires and save people or you could become a vampire lord yourself and kill people yourself. Also there are some pretty gritty quests like the ring of nimira quest that has to do with cannabilism and the dark brotherhood quest line... Although I think that in both cases you can chose to appose and destroy these organizations/cults or join them. I know that I have done a play through as a good character and as a bad one making completely different decisions. I think that this really depends on the kid that is playing and how mature they are. Overall I would rate morals 5/10...............
OVERALL - skyrim can be pretty gritty at some points but can often be avoided. Sex and drugs are extremely minimal. If you play the game like its meant to then its 6.5/10 for overall 'badness' but this can be tamed in many ways and be lowered to 4/10. This game really isn't that bad for any mature kid over 10. Also kids (or adults) with addictive personalities are probably best to stay away from this game or at least have their time monitored as it is one of the most addictive games I have ever played or that I know of. It has taken years from my life playing it over and over again. (I know I have at least 650 hrs+ on separate machines and have friends that are even worse than me).................
I hope this review helped you make an informed decision and sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors as I'm writing this pretty late at night. Ps. This game is meant to have a 5 star rating but my ipad is glitching and will only let me do 4 star for some reason. :)",0
"This game is kinda violent but this is not realistic like call of duty. In call of duty you are killing other humans, while in skyrim you are mostly killing other creature but not with guns and all that. This game is fine for kids.",1
I Love this. My ten year old son and I will always sit down with him and watch him play it. I love the gameplay. Its Fine. Not 18+,1
"I was sceptical about letting my child play a 18+, oh was I surprised why it was rated 18+ it has barely anything bad in it! Just the Violence which if your kid is not scarred by these things it’s 100% fine for them! That’s why I think anything under 12 would get scared by the violence but if your child is mature enough it’s fine.
And that Alcohol things is absolute rubbish!
But really going from one parent to another this is fine to let your 12+ kid play.",1
"The game as is fine for kids, mods on console are also fine. But if your child has his/her own PC be careful of mods that are off an adult nature. When I say this under stand this has nothing to do with the game developers as anyone can add anything to the game if they know how. Literally anything. Nude body mods, ultra violence, new dialogue containing swears or even sex animations. So make sure your child isn't installing those mods. The Nexus mod site has plenty of family friendly mods so don't freak out if your kid wants to mod the game just be sure YOU read the mod description first and know what's being added otherwise what ever has been said by other parents here won't matter as it will have a completely different rating depending on what's been added.",1
"WARNING! This game is not bad at all!
Okay, for this game, you may say ""Oh, I won't let my kid play that, just because it is rated M!""
Well, you're wrong.
This game, in itself, is not bad. The only thing that will actually be bad for a child is violence. If your child has played any Battlefield or Call of Duty game (rated t versions, Like Bad Company or World at War), they will not blink at this game. I will give the ESRB some slack. They have to take in to account everything that can harm children. Ever had your kid watch Lord of the Rings? Well, in the game, there is a drinking contest playable. The sex? Girls wear shirts, and somebody mentions it a few times. The Violence and Gore? Unless your kid is queasy, they will not even be affected by this. The gore level is very low. The blood? Not a big deal. I am a parent that is very over protective, I will admit it. Before this, my child has only played rated T games. In all honesty, this is heis first taste. He is thirteen. I have been very against blood and killing, because I think that it will affectmy kid's morality. He may think that killing is not a bi deal, or any thing that is bad. But this game, it FROWNS upon killing. Yes, that is right. It punishes you for killing. Your character can be arrested or killed in punishment, and it will affect the happiness of people around you. People that are in the game can stop trusting you as well. This game is so dense, it will blow you away. I bought it, and I played it a week before I let my son try. He loved it. If you have a mature 13 year old of an immature 15 year old, they can handle it, even if they are looked upon as your little baby. Buy it. They'll love it. I am saying this from a strict parent stand point. I would never let my kid play if I had not sampled it, but compared to madern war games, The blood level is low. MW3? GORY!!! Ask your kid if they have played those. If they have, this game will be perfect for them. If they want it, then get it. It is a great game, and it is acceptable for teens. This site frowns upon anything. Both Batman games and the entire Uncharted series are listed at 16. I would let my 8 year old boy play them. He loves super heroes, and he likes the Uncharted games. BUY IT! IT IS VERY ACCEPTABLE!!!",0
"Among the games of today Skyrim is the rarest kind of jewel. It is an experience that should be had by anyone who loves video games, and the story-line, moral choices, character development, atmosphere, and sheer gorgeous beauty of the world you are exploring make this game one of the best I have ever played. As a hard core gamer all of my life, I look at this game as a once-in-a-decade occurance. It is unique, it is individual (a very rare thing in games that are becoming increasingly fixated on only the multiplayer experience) and it is beautiful.
But that's not the point. I am a young adult, after all, and this game, as a M Rated game, is targeted towards me and middle to older teens. Is this game appropriate for children? In some ways possibly more so than most M rated games. In other ways, it is not so much inappropriate as perhaps over younger children's heads.
This game is a very difficult game. It has difficulty settings, of course, but the complexity of the world and the problems the character is presented with, the sheer vastness of an entire land to explore and dozens of quests to fullfill, make this game a likely bewildering experience to many children younger than 12, and only if those twelve year olds are experienced or fairly experienced gamers. There is a way of thinking that goes along with experience with games, and they will need critical thinking skills, trial and error, patience, and technical skill to be successful at this game. While it is extremely rewarding to wander into the wilderness of Skyrim, weak and practically defenseless and without knowing anything about the world you are entering, I entered that world as an experienced and confident gamer, and suspect that the experience would be overwhelming to younger children who do not have much experience with video games. There are just so many things to do, become, try.
Which brings us to the moral choices dilemma. It is true that in Skyrim, you can choose to become anything from the noblest man or woman to ever walk to earth, to the lowest, cruelest, piece of scum. There are many levels of gradation, unlike many games in which the good/evil moral choice aspect is presented in a way that makes you either totally good or absolutely bad. For example, you could choose to save a man from a bandit's onslaught, and yet pickpocket random people on the street. You can donate your money to homeless beggars, and then join an assassin group and kill for money. There are many moral choices in this game. To many to count. And that is why I think, in the end, this game is better than a game in which you are forced to play by default, a completely good hero or a mean antihero (as in the Grand Theft Auto games).
The kind of moral choices in Skyrim can seem scary. After all, what if your child chooses to play as the worst kind of character, a merciless killer, who would kill innocent men and women on the street to rob them of their money? First of all, the fighting in this game is far less violent than most games now days. There is a little spurt of blood, and then the body falls, completely intact (unless it is beheaded, and even then, the animation is nothing that most 12 year olds haven't seen worse of in movies or on TV). Some people I know play the game in this way and find in enjoyable. But many other people find an excersize in morality, as they try to become a genuinly good person and make decisions that will benefit those around them. It means more to be a hero in Skyrim, because you can choose not to. IT means more to choose not to lie, to choose to help someone who needs it, to choose to make a character who embodies some aspect of how you would hope to live. But at the end of the game, the character is just a character and the world is just a world. RPG's can teach us things about ourselves, and Skyrim is one such obsticle course through which we can practice steering our morality.
So this is my recommendation:seriously question whether this game is appropriate for your child if they are under 13 and not an experienced gamer. However, if the kid is 16 and older, this game might just end up being their favorite game ever.",0
"This is a fantasy role-playing game in which players assume the role of Dovakin, a prophesied figure with the power to combat dragons in the fictional world of Skyrim. As players traverse through mountainous ""open-world"" environments, they complete missions and quests that impact the eventual fate of their character. Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contain references to sexual material (e.g., “. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,” “She . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,” and “Remember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more. No problemsh . . . Thash grape!”).",0
"This is a fantastic game. I have watched my 12 year old play it and it seems amazing, I don't know how this got rated 18+. Any teenager can play this and most 12 year olds can play it. The main thing is the violence. There are axes and swords and magical things, lots of battle, nothing crazy, though. The violence is similar to the level of The Lord of The Rings. Some people are talking about sexual content, that's hardly an issue, sexual content is very low. The worst you can find is mild innuendo. You may find some people half naked but it's pretty much like being at a pool. If your child has been to a pool then the sexual content isn't a problem. The language isn't bad, not anything a 12 year old doesn't know in fact most 10 year olds actually use the language. The worst I found was the 'D' word. Some people say that there is a 'B' word somewhere in the game, didn't find that, though. It's also an amazing game, the graphics are beautiful, fun quests, big world to explore lots of nice towns and cities, wherever you go there's always something fun, the story is great, too. There is also some alcohol but that's hardly an issue. There is beer and wine but what 12 year old has never heard of that. Drugs are also present. There is a fictional drug in the game called Skooma or something, nothing bad, though. I'm sure all kids know what drugs are.
Basically the only thing you need to worry about is the violence, if your child is afraid of dragons and has nightmares from scary things then it's not for them.
If your child goes to school then they know all of the above, I've heard kids making violent jokes and things like that. A great game for 12 and up. Buy this game for your teenager/preteen! They will love it! I rate this 5/5",1
"This game is not at all violent the only blood or gore that you get is when you are fighting but it disappears very quickly, if I were the manager of this game it would only be like an 11+ issue. And there is very very mild sexual content. And the kind of sexual content you do here is just about marrying and leading a happy life with your life partner.",1
"this is an amazing game with not much violence, all it is is a hit then spray of obviously fake blood. There is no sex, only the occasional talk about it, and even that's hard to find. there is nothing remotely wrong with this game, and anyone over 12 should be allowed to play it",1
This is a very fun game. It is very entertaining and can also be educational. In this game you have the freedom to make choices. Know your kid. If you have a mature responsible kids over the age of 12 it should be fine. There is nothing I wouldn't trust my 12 year old with. There is violence and very small amounts of sexual content. But it is very rare and is very mild. Nothing kids this age can't handle.,1
"So, this game is rated M for Mature. That's wrong on so many levels.
My son, 15 at the time, asked me if he could buy this game. Now, I looked at it and was a bit skeptical so I did a bit of research. He got the game the next day. Relax, this game is fine for kids.
If your child has matured past fifth grade I think this game will be fine. It is a violent game, yes, but nothing worse that the Lord of The Rings series. Most of the time you are slaying beasts and not humans.
This game does have some swears hidden in there, but nothing your child hasn't heard before. If you let your kids watch Marvel superheroes movies they'll be able to handle this no problem.
Drugs and alcohol? It's a fantasy game, of course there'll be potions and ale, things you often see in teen rated games.
And, of course, the adult content. Probably the main reason parents are skeptical about this wonderful game. However, my boys have played this game countless times and I've even watched then play some, and we've never seen anything not safe for young boys. I did a bit of research, and the main reason I've found this game to be rated M is because of mods, which are essentially downloadable content for games. Some of these mods include content that would not be good for young boys. However, these mods all are either scams that will do nothing, or have been erased from the internet. Also, mods are hard to download. Like, really hard.
You can also get married in this game, but that's about it. If you explored every single library and town in this game, the worst you'll find is a piece of literature with swear words. Nothing bad.
In conclusion, this game is great for mature kids ages 12+
Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Christine.",0
"This game rocks! Graphics are excellent! The only real thing parents may be concerned about is Rouge the Bat. She doesn't flirt on this game, but her outfit reveals her breasts a tad. Otherwise... go and compete with a mustached plumber and a blue hedgehog!
***NOTE ABOUT ANOTHER CSM MEMBER'S REVIEW*** Steroids have been used in the REAL Olympics by dishonest athletes. There are NO steroids OR drugs used in this game; Mario, Sonic and the crew are boosted in races by a power boost built up as they run. Also, while Peach, Amy, Blaze, and Daisy DO wear short shorts, it's not really immodest enough to call ""underwear."" (Go to any ''Victoria's Secret'' and see what I mean! 0_0) There are indeed weapons in this game, but nobody gets truly hurt, and you can always remind your kids ""Don't play like that!"" I'm sure the reviewer meant well, but please be assured that this game is drug-free, sex-free, and kid-friendly! :)",1
I love to see Kirby games. Boys like Sonic and Girls like Kirby. Mario and Sonic are true friends.,1
"The game features the titular character Rayman, and his friend Globox, with the help of Teensies on their adventure through perhaps one of the most beautifully and creatively designed worlds I've seen in any game. The voilence is very slapstick, no blood or gore, when enemies and characters are defeated they simply puff up like a balloon and float off popping into thin air. The game starts out relatively easy, but gets pretty tough later on. The controls are very tight and the characters respond to everything you do precisely. Up to 4 people can play in co-op, similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The nymphs dress pretty revealingly, in short skirts and tube tops, but nothing is shown. The sound track is very good too, and the songs are pretty silly at times.",1
"This game is ridiculously cute. I adore the art style - visually, the game is stunning - and the soundtrack is the cutest thing ever. I played the original Rayman as a kid, and this really does it justice. It's way more forgiving than the first one too - each level is divided into small chunks, so if you die, you're never set back too far. The co-op play is great for friends or siblings. Just play it. Ugh, so good!",1
"This is like one of the best games ever! It is so addicting! The characters, monsters, levels, different worlds, and slapstick violence all combine to make this game worth playing! I love this game! Totally worth buying! I can't wait for the sequel(Yes, A SEQUEL)! It's gonna be called ""Rayman Legends"". It lookes as awesome as Origins!",1
"This game is very fun and easy to manipulate! There is no sex, nudity, language, drugs, or intense gore. The violence in this game consists of the enemy simply dissapering. But, like almost every single video game or app, this one can be addicting depending on the kid's maturity or age. It would give this a lower age rating, but later in the game, it does get pretty complex and requires a higher level of thinking, so it may not be fun for lower ages.",1
"This game is about exploration and fantasy. It has elves, gnomes, troll, ogres etc. This game is similar to the amazing game s k y r i m only it is cartoony so everything doesn't look that real. The best Dad is right though, The ESRB really screwed it up this time. Also like the best Dad said, there is nothing wrong with this game. This honestly should be rated T. I hope I was helpful and that you consider allowing this wonderful game into your home. Peace.",1
"Hello!
I am a father of two. I have a 13 year old and 15 year old. When I was at the store my child came to me and asked for this game. As usual I looked at the back to see what the ESRB rated it M for. Then I looked the game up on YouTube,(Because they usually over exaggerate) and found that the ESRB was exaggerating on EVERYTHING. I saw no blood. None. For the violence, it is equivalent to M i n e c r a f t. I allowed this game because I knew my 13 year old could handle it, I even think a 10 year old could handle this game but he/she should be mature. This is coming from a deeply religious father who frowns upon violence. All in all, 13 is an absolute okay for this game, I have no idea what the ESRB was thinking.",1
"Most people, kids and adults alike, are likely to ignore this fantastic game, due to a certain game (skyrim), but they would be missing out on a near-perfect game. There is very little bad language in this game, never going further than bas**rd, which is fine for an 11 year-old. There is a lot of violence, but hardly any detail whatsoever, although the skippable cutscene at the start has a severed head shown in it, but again, hardly any detail. You would be missing out on an incredible game if you don't go out and buy this right now.",1
"SSX is hands down the best snowboarding game out there. Other games pale to it and have failed in fun, presentation, execution, and usually are graphically boring in comparison. Having said all this SSX is HD for the first time and just as impressive as ever. You pull insane tricks, grind, fly high, gain boosts and navigate the mountain in several insane and fun ways including the 'squirrel' suit.......however..... the fun is now overshadowed by tasks that are often frustrating and kill the fluid gameplay that it's been known for. For instance, there is now a rewind button but it's not really for convenience, it's because you will be falling off the track so much that you will have to use it over and over just to survive on many of the missions you're given. If that sounds fun you may like the elusive 'don't run out of oxygen coming down the mountain' as you do as little as possible to just get down the hill without passing out and sometimes when it's pitch black. These additions for realisms sake cause me to recommend almost ANY other older rendition of the game. Realism is OK in some instances but it shouldn't force fun games like this into not being the over the top get together game it used to be. Oh, and now it's only 1 player local too. I can't recommend this to anyone who's played the old one unless you would enjoy the new 'realistic tasking' and online only multiplayer. Best one in my opinion was the Gamecube versions SSX On Tour where you get to be Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach or you can try SSX3 both of which are split secreen and forego the mission orientated story. They are not as graphically impressive but overall much more fun.",1
"I love, love, LOVE this game! I'm not normally a sports game guy, but man, this is extremely amazing! Snowboarding through rough mountain ranges, performing sick air tricks, and even flying through mid-air with a wing suit makes this game incredibly enjoyable! This is that kind of game that will give you an adrenaline rush feeling that makes you want to do more tricks! This game is a winner, without question!",1
"This is a wonderful game that requires reasoning to make progress. An excellent intro and simple controls help with the slightly complex gameplay. It feels like a blend of sudoku with hard sci-fi. The age rating is going to depend a ton on your kid's personality. If they like mysterious things it seems like a great redirect from other games or stories that may also have undesirable traits. I haven't finished this fairly long game yet, but I think I'm far enough in to have a sense of it's character.
It also asks some serious questions about what makes us human and what alien life could be like. Overall, this games makes you think.",1
This game wasnt as good as the first one but has new cars better graphics and new races. Sad to see no real competitors/characters like the last one.,1
"This game isn't as bad as they make it seem. There are a lot of educational components and most kids are able to understand the content in terms of the person who created this having a funny sense of humor. It's plants vs. zombies with one additional level of violence - the very cartoonish blood. At first I only let my older son play this but after sitting with him, I felt it was fine for my 9 year old. I talked with him about the game and the meaning and what being ""insane"" meant and he had really good answers. For less mature children or anyone easily spooked, perhaps wait until older. But I definitely don't think this is an 18+ game. It may be offensive to the religious, but other than that I wouldn't avoid it for the themes. The gameplay can be quite educational and themes can be good points of discussion. And you CAN find positive messages in this - i.e. don't trust voices, protect yourself, persevere, use your resources wisely etc.",1
"this game has gore, but its very cartoony and not realistic at all. The story is based on a bible story and the game is very religious. The reason this game is 18+ is because Isaac uses PILLS. which give him effects like luck down, speed up, range up, ect… But why is this 18+? at least make it 13+. Games like Omori are very dark but young people can still play them, like Omori is litterly 10+. You should really change the rating. This game is really fun and its like zelda dungeons but darker.",1
"I haven’t played the game, but my son did. He enjoyed it, but I think parents should know that the themes are super dark. The protagonist commits suicide by crawling into a box. If your kid has issues with depression I would avoid this.",0
"So I only rate this 15 and older is because of the fact of the amount of blood and gore, but it is 2D pixelations so it doesn't look very realistic. The main reason I rate it 15 and over is the amount of crude humor, such as poop which blocks your path, enemies pee themselves and enemies barf out blood to do damage, also you half to fight two giant peices of poo as a boss. there is some drugs such as pills that can harm you or just heal. there is syringe in the game to as a power up. and there is Isaac's mom who tries to kill him. If your kid can handle stuff like this, than 13 and over is a good age, but if it is too extreme than 15 and over would be best.",0
"It has pixelated/animated gore and doesn't seem to have as much violence as expected. It has tough gameplay and can be punishing if you make the wrong move... It doesn't even deserve an M rating unless there is some kind of pure nudity which is only shown 2 throughout the game (and is like a line drawn by pencil). He doesn't use guns, only rocks, animated bombs, and his tears. It should be rated T overall... It even has a local multiplayer mode, but isn't the most entertaining. Overall, the game is great and gives a good challenge!",1
"The game in itself is already really dark and touches in very mature themes like how fanaticism and overuse of religion can destroy a family, suicide, evil in general, depression and divorce. add in the (actually hardly disturbing/scary) imagery and id tell you that you shouldnt let your child get near it until hes atleast 16. maybe 15 if hes not so easily disturbed / likes to think, like always though you should check the game out for yourself, watch videos of people playing it and then make your own verdict as on what you should let your child play, anyways have fun.",0
"This game, while great at providing hours of fun, is not for your children. A lot of the details given by others are seemingly accurate, but I see bias taking precedence over logical analysis. Body horror, drugs, potty humor, and gore are all present in this game, and are not suitable for children under the age of 15. Things to note are references to illegal and unsafe abortion tactics, and the over arching theme of child abuse heavily present in both the narrative and its biblical inspiration.",0
"It's hard to describe this game. It can be extremely fun at times and give you a large sense of power when you become nearly invincible, but a lot of times you'll give up playing it for the day because you keep dying. Underneath the blood and symbolism, it has a strong role model in the form of Isaac, constantly abused by his mother and abandoned by his father, who must now stand up to his abusive mother to survive... by destroying her heart? It can be nonsensical at times but otherwise it's a pretty fun and decently violent game. Just watch out if your kids have anger issues. Seriously. Be careful.",0
"Do not think that this game is age 18+. While there may be some blood, there is not actually that much violence. The main weapon is isaac's tears, which I personally do not think is as bad as the weapons from League of Legends, which is rated teen. There are also some good messages, such as that you should not let someone kill you. For these reasons, i think that kids 9+ should be able to play this game.",1
"I was skeptical about getting this because it was rated M (and after all, there had to be a reason why it was rated m) But my child convinced me to try it out, so I let him. Then I saw that this was not anymore violent than power rangers(This is just an expression). I think the people who made rated this game did a bad job because this should be rated T.",1
"With the latest addition of Halo :Reach, the franchise is really building the hype up for the upcoming Halo Infinite on Next Gen XBox for Winter Holiday 2020. With rebooted 4k graphics , improvements and new Forge features, Reach is a perfect way to relive some local multiplayer Halo and appreciate what the most acclaimed game from the franchise has to offer. Although Reach is a $10 standlone DLC to the Master Chief Collection, it is also available on the Xbox game pass, both MCC and the Reach DLC upon release.
Although MCC was riddled with glitches and matchmaking issues, it's current state has improved VASTLY and added new games like Halo 3, 4 and now an HD revamp of Reach. It's a great and thorough collection for an avid fan or even better for someone who's never played, especially with so many couch co op options to ease the transition and play together locally.
Although some of the game versions are not as HD as others, there are so many option with multiplayer wave attacks in Firefight, building custom maps in Forge, solo and co-op campaigns, and multiple player vs player team battle modes (some with a large selection of vehicles for all out wars) etc that it's a great value no matter how you purchase or play. These are the most definitive versions of each Halo and have been made up to snuff and better than ever. This collection also includes the remastered and upgraded version of Halo 2 as well as The anniversary reworked version of the original Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 3: ODST.",1
"This amazing collection of amazing and beautiful games is not as bad for kids as you may think. Many parents might think that the Halo franchise is too violent for kids, however, when I watched my kids playing it I was surprised. I always thought that Halo was a gritty brutal shooter, but I found that I was wrong. The blood is actually different colors and really isn't that noticeable. There is a bit of swearing, so if you are sensitive to that kind of thing, you may want to be a bit careful. But apart from that Halo: The Master Chief Collection is an amazing game, that even I enjoy with my kids.",1
"I remember playing the original game when it came out. Even now it’s great, I replayed the whole thing and it was just as fun as the first time. Little bit of blood. Almost no language. Some violence but only against aliens. I don’t know what CSM is talking about, the Master Chief is a positive role model. Since when is saving the world not positive?",1
This game has quite similar themes to the popular franchise Star Wars. Most of the games in the collection are M with only a few being MA with slightly more grit. Definitely better than most titles on Xbox like Skyrim or Call of Duty. Don’t let your kids miss out on this fabulous collection of games just because of what it proclaimed on the box!,1
"I was compelled to write a review for The Master Chief Collection especially after seeing Common Sense rate it ""Not for Kids"" but give Sunset Overdrive (with its much more abrasive content) a more lenient review.
The Master Chief Collection is a compilation of the Halo games 1-4. This series revolutionized the first person shooter genre and its influence can still be seen today. The Halo games wonderfully mix narrative with sci-fi action in a way that has always sucked me in. I love this universe and the story at the heart of it.
When looking at this collection there are a tons of components to consider. You're dealing with four different games. The first game Halo:Combat Evolved contains the most profanity of any but it is light compared to the vast majority of games out there. As you play through the four campaigns you'll notice the profanity dwindle considerably. In fact, I would venture to say that all four games combined have less profanity than almost any action game you'll find (Destiny aside).
Being a shooter you can expect violence. The are little splats of blood here and there including neon blue splotches for the aliens (known as the Covenant). There are no exploding heads or graphic dismemberments to be worried about. It is worth noting that a mutated ""race"" known as The Flood make a few scattered appearances and that are quite hideous. They are more creepy than grotesque but they do contribute to the games violence.
There is also a ton of multiplayer set for online or offline. They come in co-op or competitive forms. As with any online game there is content to be aware of particularly the language that comes from other players. But there are precautions that take that out of the equation for concerned parents.
The Master Chief Collection is a Halo lover's dream. It has a bit of strong language mainly in the early campaigns and some shooter violence. But Halo has long been considered one of the tamer M rated games and parents shouldn't lump it in with so many of the other shooters that feed on graphic violence and boat loads of profanity.",0
"Halo is probably the greatest game series to ever exist, its up there with other S-Tier games like ""Half Life"", ""Fallout"", and ""Minecraft"". But the problem is, if you play this game, you've reached the top of your gaming experience. It doesn't get much better than this, so may as well play the mediocre games before you play this, because once you spend an hour on this, you will never be the same.
P.S: Call Of Duty is nothing compared to halo :3",1
"halo is a timeless masterpiece, but be warned cos it can het very graphic, enemies will bleed, explode, and get stabbed and killed in countless ways, its no doom, but there is an insane amount of blood. sgt johnson also swears a lot, with b words s words, but no f bombs. however the flood is on a whole other level,their limbs will come off, its horrifying to watch, and they could be considered light horror.",0
Ah yes.All the Halos on one disc.I say 10+ for all the singular halos but 13 for this one just cause it might be a little too much for a kid to take at once.,0
"My opinion of this game is basically that it should have a varying rating for different aspects of the game. I think that for the most part the main bit of the game is actually quite tame. While there is certainly a great deal of fighting and shooting and violence, I also think that it is well tempered by the fact that a) You play as a robot, and b) Your enemies are mostly aliens. I personally decided that I would rate this game as if it were a movie and so, looking at some of the relatively similar shows out there (Pacific Rim, X-Men, The Avengers, just to name a few) in which you watch people blowing up aliens, shooting other people and so on. Seeing as all the movies I listed were rate d PG-13, I would award the same rating to this series.
My only problem with the game is that you can play online if you pay some extra money. The multiplayer version seems much more brutal in general, so I think that my above rating applies mainly to people without access to these extra features.",0
"This thrilling first person sci-fi shooter has blown me away for the 5th time. It's one thing to re-experience halo games from the early xbox and PS generation. But playing Halo 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 back to back in one flawless collection is outstanding! But That's not all that the halo master chief collection has in store, it is also great for kids 12 and up. It is less violent than other first person games (battlefield, call of duty, Ec) The reason for this is because it focuses purely on gameplay and story line, concluding in no over the top violence. Not to mention the fact that you rarely ever kill humans. But unfortunately halo is still rated M. and for good reasons to, while the point of the game is to kill aliens (not humans) gore and blood can still be seen. which is why this game is suggested for mature 12 year olds or 13 and up. Also for any parents that worry about sexual, drinking,drugs, causing you have little to fear. Although causing is in the gameplay it is used rarely and at reasonable times.",0
"Common Sense Media seriously made this bundle sound a lot worse than it sounds. The violence is all against aliens, who bleed purple and blue blood. Occasionally red blood can be seen, mostly in the multiplayer modes. There is, however, an alien race known as the Flood, who mutate people into space zombie things. While not too violent, it may scare younger players. These creatures lose limbs when killed, but the blood is a dark green. The games do have some language, but it's nothing worse than b***h. The language is mostly present in the first two games, but three and four are pretty tame. Halo 4 does feature assassinations that involve stabbing aliens or neck snapping, but none are particularly bloody. Language is most prominent in the online modes, but chat can be disabled. All in all, this bundle is really not too bad, it's just dependent on how mature your kid is.",0
"WoW is great fun for adults 18+, assuming you can limit your time in the game fantasy world and not become addicted to it, as millions do; but I can't imagine letting my kids play it. It's simply far too violent; and graphically violent, at that.
It's not a sociopath training game, like Grandtheft Auto or Call of Duty: it's more like Lord of the Rings or classic Dungeons and Dragons - a classic fantasy adventure centering upon quests and battling monsters. But the violence makes it unsuitable to kids under 18, in my view.
Mind you, much of what kids are watching and playing now, I don't think they should be watching or playing - and I feel very strongly about it. Kids are exposed to far too much violence via TV, video games and movies.
Assuming you are playing for The Alliance, which is the loosely-speaking good faction, and not role playing a goblin warlock for The Horde, for example, feeding off the souls of the hated humans and summoning demons as helpers and friends, which seems more than a little twisted to me, World of Warcraft is a great game, if you're an adult (with a life outside the game world) - but it's not for kids, I would say.
The main issue with kids playing any video game, to my mind, is, as with TV, smart phones, tablets and computers, how much time they spend staring into a screen, largely disconnected from the real world of lived experience. A one hour a day, or seven hour a week time limit should be strictly kept, I would urge. Kids and adults should read books, interact face to face with others, get outside, and stay physically active. But content is a serious issue, too.
There is a difference between Dora the Explorer and Kill Bill. Some games, TV shows and films are suitable for kids. WoW is not one of them.",0
This is a very good game with a good plot. The definitive edition cuts out some unnecessary nudity compared to the original. moderate suggestive themes and moderate gore.,0
"I hated the original DMC, but came around when Devil May Cry 2 came out, then 3, then 4 was HD but not quite as good and more repetative. OK. The controls are tight as ever with the familiar frantic hack and slash gameplay, which hasn't changed a ton, but has some new toys that become easy to get a handle on. There IS a 'use the right color weapon' mechanic that is gleened from cheesier games and make certain segements a tedious 'color match' fight,but it doesn't ruin it, just bogs down the experience for a minute making you want to just 'get through it'. The bosses are huge and on par with the series and definitely a highlight and the henchmen critters are satisfying to dispatch on a regular basis minus an annoying one or 2. You have scythes, swords, guns and Hulk Hand fists to punch with making it diverse but often pigeon holed to using certain items. The BIG downer is this is STRICTLY not for younger players. I hate this about the game but it is extremely gross. One section has a demon come from his mothers youknowwhat while still attached. These moments are not persistant, but do leave a stain and a memory that anyone playing will most likely never shake, and to marketting, that's probably the idea. It seems like a waste to take a great game and narrow it down to an audience willing to put up with grotesqueries in order to play. Perhaps it would be wise for them to cut 5 minutes out of the game for an optional PG 13 version, but that's not likely to ever happen. And although the hyper sexed game Bayonetta is extremely exploitative and borrows many of DMCs ideas, THIS game is the worst in the genre and in the series by far.",0
This game revolves around dante. A demon who kills other demons because they are more eviler or something. There is some language but nothing too much. Some sexual innuendo.,0
"All around great.
Only thing I would change is make the sheep not drown if you drag them into the sea.",1
"Great game, no explicit sexual content, however references to sex and sexual acts that are incestuous do occur, which may be triggering for certain viewers.",0
"A pretty good game, but not at all like the original King's Quest games. Stick to the classics.",1
"I'm a Forza veteran, and this is by far the best of the series, not just for the improved graphics and tons of content, but for subtle gameplay adjustments that make the game feel rewarding whether you're just starting out or have been playing for months.
Bottom line - if you or your kids have any interest in racing games, you should pick this one up. By turning various Assists off or on, you can make the game as hard or as easy as you like, and you can handicap better players to even the odds between you and your kids. And, unlike the Forza Horizon games, Forza 6 still features split-screen multiplayer, so you can compete with someone on the same couch, not just online. There are, however, three concerns that parents might have with this game. 1) Open multiplayer chat. Like most online games, the chat is not monitored. In my online experience, the majority of players online seem to be adults, or at least teenagers. In a game where you can crash into people, spin them out, or run them off the road, tempers can flare and the language can get fairly abrasive. However, there is a great multiplayer mode in the game called Ghost League, where collisions are turned off. All your opponent cars are semi-translucent, and you simply drive through them. If someone runs off the road or crashes, it's no-one's fault but their own, so the tempers are decidedly cooler and cursing is a rarity. 2) Advertising. Like real auto racing, ads are everywhere - on billboards, footbridges, guard walls, and the cars. There are a few scattered ads that your kids might have some interest in (e.g. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sargento Cheese, etc...), but the VAST majority are for car companies or car-related products (e.g. Mobil 1 oil). Your kids won't even give them a second thought. ""But, MOM, why can't we get Recaro seats for the minivan?!?"" Any remotely objectionable ads are only on the cars (e.g. Marlboro, Jack Daniel's), not the racetracks, and they are few and far between. 3) Mature Car Designs; or rather, immature car designs. There is a burgeoning community of people who create ""Vinyls"" (i.e. stickers or decals) and whole car designs (i.e. paint jobs), which you can easily download, change, or use to make your own. The majority are racing-oriented liveries, but they run the gamut from the abstract, to superheroes, SpongeBob, and Holiday themes. There is, however, a trend for (mostly) Japanese cars to sport anime/manga-style girls on them. Some are quite tame, of the Final Fantasy or Pokémon variety, but other cars are draped with doe-eyed females of impossible proportions and dubious legal age, straining their skimpy bikinis to the limit. Most of these require a dedicated search to find (or so I've heard...ahem), but a few of the more well-done ones can occasionally show up in the default assortment of available paint jobs you are presented with when you buy a car. Your eight-year old probably won't care, but your teen will definitely take notice. It's actually quite remarkable that these and all the other designs were painstakingly created using the game's simple painting controls, but it's amazing what you can accomplish when you put several thousand (or more) polygons and other simple shapes together.",1
"This compilation has all the important NES Mega Man games and represents them quite well. The graphics are 1-1, the gameplay is top banana and should only be reserved for the most hardcore of gamers as the Mega Man series is world renowned for it's difficulty. If you have little kids, don't give them this game as it will make them get angry.",1
"This game consists of 6 amazing classics that every kid should play. i full-heartedly recommend this game, however be aware that the difficulty might be too hard for little kids.",1
"the best of the best its worth it
my rate 10/10",1
"It really depends on how your child handles horror. There are some jump scares, but the game is mostly psychologically disturbing. Baby dolls creepily smacking their heads repetitively against things, disturbing (though not inappropriate) paintings, creepy noises and lights going out, etc. One minute you walk into a room, turn around and the door is gone behind you, or the hallways continue in an endless loop. The game is first person, about a mystery surrounding a murder, and the player is left to explore a haunted house. Lots of little puzzles in the rooms.
There is light drinking and some swearing in the game. No sex, some violence. Mostly just sort of disturbing.
My 11 year old loved it. The game even frightened me a little bit when me and my husband played it the first time around. I was a little hesitant to let my kid play it due to it maybe scaring her a little too much, but it turned out fine. If your child has frequent nightmares or is not accustomed to the horror genre yet, wait a few years or test the game out yourself, first.",0
Very Good But The First Game Is Better,1
"This is a great game and fun for most ages but I encourage adults to play it for awhile and see what kind of ads pop up. My 5 year old son was playing it and suddenly I heard, ""don't look that isn't proper!"" I took the tablet and an ad video showing pretty much naked anime girls hanging over half naked guys was playing. I am just glad I was there. I promptly deleted all snail bob games, its not worth it.",0
"The game itself is a great game, but you when add in people on the internet it changes everything. There is a lot of ERP (erotic role players, sex chat)
None of the chat channels are monitored. The things people talk about in open chat channels make me cringe at the thought of some children are reading it.
You are constantly harassed by gold sellers who will hack your game account and credit cards.
You can turn off all chat and play but then it makes it almost impossible to participate in many game group features.
The game itself is great, but people on the internet can really ruin it for younger players.",0
"There is no more violence than there is on Minecraft.
However, the game is beautiful compared to Minecraft and the gameplay much more fluid.
There is no nudity or bad language in this game.
Also all the crafting is logical, like for example when making a stone axe you need to gather wood and stone. Minecraft is not in that aspect.
A very good and cheap alternative that also supports gaming for LAN and online gaming with very easy setup.
I bought 3 lisences for my kids 6 and 8 and they are going crazy over it. I actually enjoy playing it too.
Think of it as a crossover between Minecraft and WoW without the violence, gore or language.
The games also offers progressive worlds (adventure mode) through it's smart Portal system that makes you revisit old world for materials. +on gameplay there.
One of the most kid friendly co-op titles out there.",1
"Our 5 and 8 year old love to play this. This is the game that taught our 5-year old to use all the buttons on the Xbox controller. After nearly a year this is still her favorite game.
You can play adventure mode, with monsters and quests (reading required to understand quests, but they aren't necessary), or you can play creative mode where you just build. A bit like Minecraft, but cuter graphics and music.",1
"I have been playing Overwatch for over a year. As everyone here has stated, the animated violence of this game is not bad at all. Much better than other games in this genre. There is one massive hole that I'm not seeing here that parents should be made aware of. The ESRB states that this game is rated ""Teen"". However, if you read a bit deeper you see ""Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB"". For parents that don't know, this game is ONLY online. I.e. they can't play it without other human players. Since this is an online game and ESRB does not rate online interactions one might assume that ""this is a good game for my teen"".
In short, some players in this game very toxic and your teen WILL be exposed to this. What do I mean by toxic? First off, the language. If any one character in the game said some of what these people say this would get smacked with an ""M"" (in some cases, worse). Some say that toxic players say things like ""too ez"" after winning a game, that is not what I'm talking about at all. Those people are just poor sports. Toxic players are much, much worse...
Second, insults and personal attacks are very common. The anonymity of the game (as with the web) brings out the worst in people.
I'd like to close with a few things:
* The toxic players are in every online game, even games like Minecraft. If your child plays online they are exposed to this.
* Blizzard has done some things that make it so blocking players doesn't work (no, you can't effectively block these toxic players because people were blocking ""good"" players). This is a choice Blizzard made. There is a ""block player"" command but I haven't seen it work, I still end up playing with people I've blocked...
* There is a reporting feature in Overwatch. I'll leave it up to the reader to do a Google search to determine how effective reporting this to Blizzard is.
* You can do some muting (voice and text). It has been my experience that this is near useless, especially in Competition where it is expected you have a mic (team communication is very important in this game). This is where most of the Toxic players end up. I don't play Competitive matches anymore. You are guaranteed a toxic player (very likely more than one; like on the school yard they ""gang up and feed off each other"").
I haven’t heard of anyone being banned from Overwatch for anything other than game modification (cheating). Blizzard knows if cheaters infest the game that people will leave. Either you cheat or you lose. To be clear, I can understand Blizzard’s position; a ban is major. Someone won’t be able to play the game anymore after buying it. But, perhaps, the solution isn’t to just throw up your corporate hands and say “well, there is nothing we can do” or “this is in every game so we won’t do anything”. More monitoring on the part of Blizzard is necessary.
I just wanted others to know that ESRB and the other statements here are correct but missing (IMHO) a very vital component which is the online play. Remember, this isn't just Overwatch (the only online game I play, likely the last). I’m sure all online games are like this but I would hope that other companies who support these games do a better job than Blizzard at dealing with these players.
Want some entertainment? Google ""youtube overwatch toxic player"" and watch a few. Then realize that those are the ones that got recorded, most don’t.
-------------------------
I would like to say, i went in to the blizzard control panel and blocked my sons (and my own) voice. I have tested for the last hour and I haven't heard a peep. While i've blocked players that are toxic in text chat, it is nowhere near as bad now that I have made it so that audio is completely blocked. It is a fun game, your kids will like it. You, as a parent, need to block this however.",0
"As an adult all in all I think this is a great game. Honestly I love to waste time on it, it has many complex themes and a handful of good characters to aspire to be like.
Though, I am concerned about the amount of younger children who play this game. This is not a game for children. While at face value it's a friendly FPS the more you dive into the story side of the game there are themes of death and violence. The voice lines are usually tame, but some of the characters offhandedly mention alcohol to each other, threaten possibly killing each other and are generally at each others throats.
Also, the competitive mode is not a good place for children, as people can get very upset if someone is playing badly and begin shooting off at the mouth. Heck, I've heard children even being disrespectful and running their mouth on there. My suggestion is if you are going to let children play, don't let them have mics and go into the settings and turn off the chat options.
Online interactions are not rated by the ESRB, so treat it as a rated M game. People online will not hesitate to tease your kid, especially if they decide to run their mouth.",0
"I love this game. There is a diverse range of characters from all over the world of all different sexualities (and even species). There is very mild blood and only sparse swearing, smoking, and drinking).
That, however, is just the game itself. What isn't rated is the online interaction. This is a team based game. You are teamed up with 5 other random people to play against another assembled team. You have to be able to communicate with each other or gear up to lose a lot of games. When an 8 year old is on with an open mic and we can hear you screaming at your little darling in the background, it makes it really hard to coordinate your team. Then, the angry teammates will introduce your kid to a bunch of new slurs to use on the playground (and they are VERY creative).
They do have a blocking and reporting system (where the offender can get muted or even blocked forever), but by that time, the damage is already done. You can also put a profanity filter on the text chat, but the adults on the game are sly to that and have creative new spellings for their slurs and swearing.
If you want to toss all this aside and let little Billy play, then for the LOVE OF GOD do not let him play in Comp. It's a ranked system that boosts you up or down according to wins and losses. Even the best and most mature players can loose their cool at a loss due to some 12 year old playing Genji whining in the mic that he can't get heals.
They don't want little Billy there, and they will be happy to tell him what he can do with himself. Don't put your kid or the gaming community through that.
I put that it's good for 16+, but that's really if you think your 16 year old can handle being a gracious loser and not become more of the problem by toxicly screaming at others when they lose. I will report your kid. Happily and in great detail.",0
"Basically, I wasn't sure about this at first when my son wanted to get it. But after watching it, decided to get it. I have played it a few times and is super fun, especially using Reaper and Widow maker. My son loves it. Some cleavlage and skin tight suits and some inappropriate custom private matches, along with mild blood if enemy is hit and very sci-fi weapons, with some being basically a unrealistic freezer gun that can shoot ice. Some mild swearing like hell and D*mn, but very rare. Again, very fun.",0
"I have no idea why this game is rated teen, no sense in it. there is like nothing bad in it unless you don't like guns. There is no blood no graphics no drinking or any of that no swearing no anything bad. So besides the guns this is like 2 and up, there is guns so 6 and up.",1
"If your kid is interested in this kind of game it's a great starting point. There's nothing bloody or graphic, it promotes team play, and it's a very postive game overall, especially compared to others in the genre.",1
The developers at blizzard did a fine job advertising and selling this game but now they are not adding anything new so far. This is an amazing game but they need to add something new.,1
"Overwatch is a once in a lifetime online game. It's cutesy and fun gameplay make for a fun time with family, and though there is cartoon violence, there is no blood whatsoever but when your child is playing online you have to watch out for the open chat ( swearing). Otherwise, it is perfect for tweens and up and I would definitely recommend getting this for your child.",1
"The game is not worth the money or time that people put into it. With every single update that is released it just gets worse and honestly the game is dead, it is also full of toxic players, so I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have a positive experience.",0
"There is lots of violence... but I think that any kid 9 and up can understand that all the violence is fake. You can talk with people online, but it's easy to disable that.",0
Great game. i play Overwatch on PS4 and I play a similar free game called Paladins on Switch. Both these games don't have much violence or blood whatsoever. I think the violence rating on both of these games is the fact that you shoot other players online. Nothing is wrong with these game and I think they can get away with an E10+ rating.,1
"I never expected my 6 and 9 y.o. daughters to get so engaged in Quake alike 3D first person shooter, but they are doing great. Even my 3 y.o. seem to enjoy practice range and some basic controls, like W, S and mouse.
Anyway, technically violence is very mild, there is no blood and gore, the game is bright and engaging. However, typical Quake concept of running around shooting people and respawning (i.e. reversibility of death) could be a little bit disturbing. They do seem to understand the concept of pretend violence in the form of cyber-sport and they are OK with that.
Both of them have tried M rated shooters, like DOOM and Dead Space 2/3 and they don't like them at all, mostly because of setting, visuals and the form of enemies, even though they are technically capable of playing them.
Back to Overwatch. I would rate the game as 6+, with some form of parental guidance, but only in Practice vs A.I, Arcade and Quick Play modes, without microphone and with chat disabled in settings.
Competitive mode is for 16+ only. Folks are getting really upset there. Swearing and insults are commonplace and, you know, online conversations are not rated by ESRB.",0
"When it comes to MMOs you can't go wrong with WoW, with age it's only gotten more casual friendly as well, less time needed to progress, certain character classes are much easier for younger children to play and plenty to do outside of the typical end game features expected from MMOs.",1
"We got the switch for Christmas and my mother got my son Zelda, Breath of the Wild. This is a game we play together and offers me great teaching opportunities. For the more difficult parts I’ll play(bosses mostly) The puzzles are amazing and allow me to teach my son cooperative problem solving. The graphics and music are absolutely beautiful. The world is huge, completely open ended and you aren’t required to play the game in any particular order. There is mild violence but no blood and gore. To be honest my 6 year old sees more graphic violence watching and playing football than playing this game. Just be forwarned it is quite difficult in some parts and if you aren’t planning to help your child play it it’s probably not appropriate for kids 8 and under.",1
"I actually really enjoyed watching my husband and 8 year old play this together. It's so beautiful and interesting. The side quests are fun and the game play lasts a LOOOOONG time. They will be working on it for a long time, making it worth the money. It really is a fantastic game. I think if my 8 year old played it by himself, it would have been to hard for him though. Good for a family of gamers.",1
"The excitement of having an ""open world"" Zelda game is enough to make someone dive right in and spend hours getting the main character,Link, equipped and battle ready after waking from his slumber. Some flaws do hinder the experience, but overall the camera, the enemy target locking system and the slow motion dodge mechanics all work very well and minimize frustration with minimal ""unfair "" deaths. This allows the player to earn his victories fairly and smoothly with a very cooperative and even battle system. Although the Nintendo Switch as a console is quite underpowered compared to it's peers, the cartooish graphics of Zelda still look great and the attention to detail in all these other areas more than compensate for the gritty detail of many games of it's kind to the point that you don't even notice or care, especially after you get into the adventure early on. The only glaring flaw between the Switch and Wii U version is the occassional ""hiccup"" in battles on the Switch version which can cause a frame rate drop in certain areas. Once you experince this, however, you know where these rare spots are and can avoid repeat occasions.
After you experiment and pull off the more intimidating moves you realize that they are actually less diffuicult than they 'look' on the screen, making a very satisfying payoff when you pull off these 'tricks' and are able to chain moves together. Very often you run into powerful enemies that can 'bake your cookies' very quickly, but you always have the option of approaching from multiple directions with different approaches in your arsenal. You can tackle these encounter in several different ways making each encounter as unique as you like. With many powers at your disposal later on you discover that experimentation and toying with these abilities are perhaps even more fun than the encounters themselves.
The few drawbacks I took into consideration were these: Weapons break, ALOT, which is odd that a ""realistic"" mechanic like this was implemented in a game of this nature because you can still carry a truckload of weapons for no reason at all, but they all break like they were made at a toy factory and are far too brittle. this causes you to use different weapons and juggle inventory, but when a weapon breaks mid battle, which is all the time, you are left scrambling to scrounge another weapon from inventory. Although you can pause mid battle to do this, it is especially annoying in major fights and really takes away from the continuity and flow of battle.
The enemies can get repetitive. There are basically 2 organic races and 'sentinel' robots you will be battling with some exceptions and winged nuisances, but you will be essentially dispatching these same enemies throughout. The bosses break this up and are interesting encounters with a memorable battle sequence and puzzle to solve but the tedium of these familiar battles sets in after awhile.You will spend most of your time traversing a very large space of land to find 'shrines' in order to solve a dungeon puzzle or challenge with mini sentinals. There is variety here, but noticeably not enough for a sandbox game of this size.
Cooking....you will be doing hours of this if you want to survive the harshest battles. You can experiment with this as well and it is a unique feature that is very interesting at first. You can't save recipes though so once you find something effective you need a pen and paper to keep your found recipe for later. This however , can also require large chunks of time and become borish after your experimentation early on.
You can tame and ride horses, stable multiple steeds, use a glider for traversing high to low areas of any height. Between the shrines you can climb towers which open your maps and give you even more challenges and exploration. There are even hidden challenges along the way and side quests. The only real downside is these are all acheived with these same drawbacks mentioned before, which may be a deal breaker for some, especially after getting deep into the game.
On a final Added note to parents, there are fountain fairies that are oversexulized in the game which may cause some concern. There is no nudity, but these giant women are 'well endowed' in a very obvious and purposeful way. The dialogue is not overt but hints at flirtation at times, and along with some awkward 'swooning' noises, may be inappropriate for younger players. In an otherwise family conscious action title, it's awkward and out of place in an otherwise tame themed game.",1
"This game is very fun and all ages should play it, and don't tell any kid over 6 no to this game, unless you don't like the price. But the game will be very challenging because of all the puzzles, I really needed to help my kids with this one. But if your kids have ever played uncharted they will be fine. The uncharted games were way more inappropriate and just a little harder. So if you leta young kid get this game, help them out.",1
A little difficult for younger kids. Overall a great game. Nintendo really outdid themselves with this game. I highly recommend it to everyone!,1
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a high fantasy adventure game where the hero Link explores and survives the wilderness of the lost kingdom of Hyrule.
True to their family-oriented style, this Nintendo game does not indulge in violence, gore, sex, profanity or drug use.
BotW features fantasy violence, with weapons like swords being used against fictional monsters. No blood or damage is ever shown. Deaths are quick, with monsters turning to black and disappearing in a puff of smoke. The bosses ""bleed"" a substance known as Malice, which is more of a physical manifestation of hatred and it is made clear that they are not living creatures like the rest of us.
Some characters make a flirtatious ""hmm"" or giggle to Link, but nothing you wouldn't find in a PG film.
Very minor alcohol use is suggested in one location. While never directly called alcohol, Link is told he is ""too young"" for the drink and can never obtain it.
No profanity.
Some scenes may be scary to very young children, which is why this game is given a 12 (or equivalent) rating all around the world.",0
"This game is amazing! The art style is beautiful, and the endless possibilities are a nice touch. In this adventure, Link goes on a quest to save Hyrule from an awaking evil. On the way, you'll encounter enemies that Link can battle, puzzles to solve, and over 100+ side quests.
There is NO blood or gore, instead, the enemies disappear into a puff of smoke. All the characters (specifically women) are dressed modestly. There is no profanity or sex either. There is a reference to alcohol though, as there is a lady who runs a shop in the game who sells drinks that ""are definitely just for adults"". Thankfully Link can never obtain these drinks for himself. In addition, there is a character within the game that says ""heck"".
Overall I'd say this game is great for kids 9+ and will provide endless amounts of fun for kids looking for an ever expanding and amazing adventure.",1
"First off, if there are any families out there concerned with fantasy elements within media, I suggest you go and read J.R.R. Tolkien's essay on fairy tales.
Great Messages/Role Models - Link is a self sacrificing hero through and through. In the story he has already given his life in a way for the safety of his people. The game starts with Link waking up in something called The Shrine of Resurrection (Note that link did not actually die, but was severely wounded and needed to recover in this sort of stasis healing pod). Link wakes up 100 years after Gannon (the main bad guy) attacked the kingdom. Link failed to stop him and was gravely wounded. Zelda then managed to ""seal"" Gannon in the castle. While Link was recuperating, Zelda has been fighting Gannon in the castle for 100 years (presumable kept young by some magic used).
There is violence in this game. Link faces off agains monsters of all sorts. The message here is best stated by G.K. Chesterton: ""Fairytales don’t tell children that dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairytales tell children that dragons can be killed."" Younger children might need to be guided by a parent to this meaning, but older children may find a role model in the character of Link. He stands up for what is right and seeks to destroy evil in his world even though the odds are against him.
Easy to Play/use: This is the hardest Zelda game to date. Definitely not for younger kids. That being said 10 year olds should find this game challenging but doable. Learning enemy patterns and combat is difficult at first, but will eventually be mastered. There are 120 ""shrines"" that present easy-difficult puzzles using the games incredible physics and environment engine. There are multiple ways to solve puzzles throughout the game which promotes creativity in all areas of play.
Consumerism - In this game you do collect a lot of items, but the majority of them are earned or found rather than simply purchased. An underlying theme of the game is exploration. The map is vast and any player will want to explore every single mountain top and valley just to see what's there. The currency of the game does play a big role in acquiring some items, but it is not the focal point of the game.
Drinking/drugs/smoking - There is one area where there is a bar and they tell you that you can't have any of their drinks because you are under age. In the bar there is one character who is passed out. This is a side quest that does not need to be completed and would most likely go over the heads of most children.
Swearing - No foul language at all
Sex - There are a few things to mention here. Firstly, in the game there are 4 great fairy fountains that player can locate. The fairies huge and dressed extravagantly with tons of make up and glitter. Like a form fitting sparkly bathing suit. They have large breasts but the game doesn't focus on them. They make comments on how Link is handsome and when they upgrade his gear (that is their function) they blow kisses, hug, kiss Link in a way that is to be seen as comical. They are not a huge part of the game, and you can literally play for hours and hours without encountering one.
Secondly, in the South Western part of the map, there is a race called the Gerudo. They are a race of tall, muscular women. (Think Amazon type). Tall (almost twice as tall as Link), dark skin (some are lighter). There are older, younger, and children Gerudu, and there are different body types as well (some are huskier and more heavy set, I give some props for Nintendo for including this). However, the majority of them are tall, slim and muscular. They wear baggy pants with an exposed belly and bra top. One of them is a Champion that Link knew in the past and is in a few cut scenes (but not in a sexual way, aside from here costume). A small detail that most won't notice is that all the Gerudo wear slightly elevated heels. A detail I wish wasn't in the game as heels are sometimes seen as ""sexy."" There is no love interest with any of these characters, but Link does need to disguise himself as a girl to gain access to their town because they don't allow men in. Again, this cross dressing is meant to be comical and makes no attempt to push agendas that are outside of gaming. The Gerudo are warriors and definitely do not take the whole ""damsel in distress"" role. Two of the champions that Link fights beside are female, so there are strong female characters present (more on that in a moment). Aside from the Gerudo and the Great Fairies all other female characters are dressed modestly.
A Damsel in Distress - One of the critiques of this game is that it promotes that men must always save women and that women need to be rescued. The main story of all the Zelda games is in fact that Link needs to save Zelda from Gannon. But more modern Zelda games put a different twist on it (In Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Zelda actually disguises herself as a ninja type character to fight alongside and aid Link). In Breath of the Wild, Zelda is indeed in need of rescuing, but only because Link failed to protect her the first time they encountered Gannon, and she has been fighting Gannon on her own for the past 100 years while you recovered in the stasis healing pod. Part of the story is that Zelda has struggled to find the her purpose and power necessary to overcome the evil in the world. Only after Link fails to protect her, does the power become realized within her, and she uses that power to save Link from death at the hands of a monster. At first glance you could see only ""man saving woman"" but a closer look at the story shows that there is more going on. Two of the champions are female and were chosen to be champions because of their capability and skill in planning and battle.
Themes in Zelda: In most Zelda games the relic called the Triforce plays a major role. In Breath of the Wild, it is curiously absent save for veiled references. The Triforce is represented by three golden triangles each representing the virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage. These virtues were created by the Goddess Hylia (the supreme God of the Zelda universe) and represented by three lesser spirits or dragons depending on the game. In each game Link always possess the Triforce of courage, Zelda has the Triforce of wisdom, and Gannon (the bad guy), the Triforce of power. Gannon seeks control of all three so he can conquer the world. How he originally got the triforce of power remains unknown, but it can be used to teach children that power itself isn't evil, but if you have wisdom and courage alongside it, power can be a power for the forces of good in the world.
In Breath of the Wild, Gannon is depicted as a monster (in earlier games he was a Gerudo man but that's another discussion). The game states that in his lust for power he lost all resemblance to humanity and became an embodiment of Evil. There is no pity for this character in Breath of the Wild, only a driving need to defeat evil and rebuild the world it destroyed.
I hope this article helps you decide if this game is worth letting your kids play. This game is truly a masterpiece!",1
"Breath of the Wild
I love Breath of the Wild, it is amazing! It is a very open world game which makes it amazing, you can do literally WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO!!!! I love fighting all of the monsters, but my favorite is the lynel and guardians. A lynel is basically a centaur with a lion mane and horns.
A guardian is a robot that shoots lasers at you!!!
One of the most important items in the game are weapons. You need weapons to attack monsters. My favorite weapon is the Ancient Bladesaw.
Bows are also a helpful weapon. My favorite bows are the Savage Lynel bow and the Ancient bow.
Armor gives you defense and sometimes a power for example Zora armor lets you swim up waterfalls when you wear it. My favorite armor set is Ancient armor.
Another thing that is great about this game is horses. You can ride them only if you can catch one!!! I have a giant horse named Pumpkin (it is black with tiger orange mane) when you ride a horse you can twirl a spear you are holding.
Dishes are great for recovering hearts and stamina instantly, and certain dishes can give you buffs ( A buff is a positive effect.) such as cold resistance. A great dish is made with 5 hearty durians and that gives you full heart recovery and 20 extra hearts!
I love this game so much I fell for an April Fools Day prank on YouTube. I found all 3 dragons in the world and got a shard of each of their teeth and a giant ancient core to make an ancient key so I could “ride in a Guardian” and I found out that it was not real. &gt;:(
Overall this game is amazing. I highly suggest Breath of the Wild!!! ;)",1
"As a mother with an 8-year-old son, I appreciate the lack of violence in the game. The great fairies mentioned are not sexualized at all, they are simply fairies who upgrade links armor. There is no romance or sexuality which I think is good, as I bought this game for my 8 yr old. I supervise him while playing, and the foraging aspect of the game made him ask me to go to the park so he could ""build a fort"" and ""make a master sword."" there is no cursing in the game, and I've found that it had a positive effect on my child. I definitely recommend it.",1
"I am a HUGE fan of the Legend Of Zelda series but BOtW has to be my favorite it is such a great game and it is even better than my personal favorite Majoras Mask. First the violence isnt that bad, most enemys will when you kill them they blow up in a cloud of smoke also if you think that some enimies ooze blood they actually are oozing a substance called mailce also those of you that say the faries are over sexualised is because they are supposed to be sexy and have big tits also there is great role models and its easy to play and for those of you that think tits is a bad word who cares",0
"I put my age rating at 9, but my 7 year old step daughter plays this game and enjoys it. Without help from us though she would struggle a lot in some places. She gets frustrated because even though I’m farther than her in the game, there’s still so many questions she has that I just don’t know the answers to. If you can handle that sort of frustration in your kids, I’d say even younger than 9 would most likely be okay to play it, but totally depends on the individual kid. I did find one curse word in the game, but I think it’s not a common dialogue to find, as it requires you leaving the Divine Beast Medoh in the middle of it and speaking with Tebo. It’s nothing too explicit with it only being the word “dammit”, but worth noting anyways.",1
"I enjoy it, its best for a group of four players. Violence and gore is consistent, what you see is mostly what is in the entire game. I will warn that there is actually partial nudity (topless woman), and its only after you unlock a certain character. I point that out because I saw no mention in the current guide.",0
"Final Fantasy XII, when you fully analyze it, is a sophisticated, artistic and very in-depth game, from its interface to its world-building lore, all the way to the way how many locations are pretty massive. It is, however, a very long-winded game, even in this version that has a speed-up feature - As such, while I could certainly recommend the game for kids 14 and older, I would extend the caveat that the individual, kid or adult, would require an intense mental discipline to see it through.
Some games I refer to as a ""thinking person's game"", but usually these are ones that require a considerable amount of concentration on the task, such as a massive Real-Time Strategy, but Final Fantasy XII is different -- It tells a very long story with many, perhaps too many, secondary characters, and as such keeping track of how everything plays out requires a considerable amount of memory. Think of this as long-term complex thinking, like reading a Tolkien novel, as the number of moving parts that you need to keep track of in the long-term are quite considerable (and many of which are largely irrelevant, one of the few things I would say genuinely against the story the game tells). It also deals with rather adult themes such as how often times tyrants and oppressive rulers will often times operate as a friend of the people, or how attempting to help those around you can have adverse affects, and that not all allies are permanent as your overall objectives might be considerably different, only in-line with each other in the short-term. The game also features a Shakespearian prose for many characters, so one requires a careful ear for any younger gamers.
In terms of the game itself, it has sharp dialogue, some wonderful symphonic music, a fun playstyle, varied landscapes and enemy types, a complex, multi-layered world of differing races and societies, and a solid art style that is unique but doesn't go overly extravagant as some entries like X and XIII. It's a competent Quasi-Action/RPG that requires strategy and long-term concentration in regards to the storytelling, and for this I would recommend it for smart older children, and adults.",0
"This game is very deep but has nothing inappropriate at all! Yes there is some blood but no gore. There is absolutely no swearing at all. It is very good and does not deserve the M eating it gets. Probably the best RPG I’ve ever played and I highly recommend it! If you are on the fence and think it will be inappropriate just because it has an M rating, you should get it because it is appropriate. 10/10",1

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
Rating Summary
-- The game contains some sexual material: the central character can employ the services of a prostitute at a pub—no sexual activity is depicted, though the dialogue/text makes sexual references (e.g., “Your hand slides all the way up until you reach her, and you make a soft circling motion with your thumb”; “Slowly she undresses you then takes you to bed""; ""Your world explodes in bliss.""). The word “sh*t” is heard in dialogue.
Really you 3 adults above would you let your younger teenagers play this game with that in it? One person would let their 9 year old play it?",0
"Give this review a full read before making your decision. This game has its mature aspects for sure. There IS some mild profanity. There IS ONE single tiny quest that involves suggested sex and is so out of the way and obscurely described that I doubt a young mind would pick up on it. There IS suggestive drinking and drug usage. There IS violence and mild blood.
BUT: This game presents moral choices, problem solving, and general adventure in such a wonderful way. Your choices have genuine impact on others and the world around you. Everything in the game takes planning as rushing into things often ends in failure and unforeseen consequences. If your child already grasps slightly more complex games then this is an excellent seque into a more immersive world.",0
"Fantasy violence from a distant perspective. Not for little kids, but fine for all teens",0
"I've been a fan of the series since it started over a decade ago! Remember Gran Turismo over 20 years ago? Remember being frustrated at too many tuner cars, Mitsubishis, Toyotas? Forza solved that with a more Western bias. It was like a miracle. There is no problem giving it to your kids here. They will enjoy it to their hearts content.",1
it is a great game good grafics its a really great game,1
Magnificent gameplay and beautiful serene adventuring around the beautiful world. Kids love riding around on the horse and the world is safe. Colossi are difficult but not scary. The spray shadows not blood. Basically PG till one cut scene in the end and an eight or nine-year-old could complete it.,1
"Violence: Overall grim tone, some text references to death and violence. A handful of still images depict small amounts of blood. | Sex: One building that can be built is a brothel, however, nothing is shown and there's no descriptive dialogue either. | Language: Rare instances of ""hell"" and ""f*ck"" in text. | Drugs: Passing references to alcohol.",0
"Game is very kid friendly, could be compared to games such as minecraft (but there are no zombies)
You start in the cold off with no shelter no food and many people. Make your own laws such as improving people's lives through making care homes for the physically disabled or even inventing new recipes to feed more people while using less materials.
Overall a good game with good challenges and never a boring moment.",1
"It’s a great game and I have searched for ages to find one appropriate for both my kids. Although the point is to push, knock, throw the other player off the map there is no real violence or bad content. Both my kids are loving it and I am really happy.",1
"I have to kids an 8 year old and a 13 year old, and have spent a long time trying to find a game that is ok for both of them, and this is definitely the one. Their is actually none of all the stuff described in 10 + reviews. And although knocking the other player off the edge of the map is the aim it’s all cartoon and there is no real violence or blood no one gets hurt.",1
"Because smash has special skills but there is no blood and gore added to
the game. There is no bad language but some characters wear skylight
suits which shows some sex refrences but there is no alcohol and drug
abuse in this game.",1
"Given the genre it is exactly what you'd expect, punching, kicking, throwing fire balls etc. but all very tame.
A really good beat'em'up with a tonne of content.",1
"Such a fun game! As a family we really enjoy playing it together. Lots of different characters to get and play with. 8+ because some characters have revealing clothing- not too big of a deal, but worth mentioning (so annoying that game developers even add that...). Overall lots of fun!! Definitely recommend it!",1
"For my kids 9 and 11 years old, it was a really fun game that kept them entertained on long trips and other journeys. It went really well with their recent purchase another set of joycons and when I looked at it seems to be appropriate.",1
"This game is revolved around fighting which already is a minus, In this game u can master the game pretty easily but its not too good for new gamers, but overall besides the violence and the consumerism its not that bad!",0
"I play this game soo much that it is embarrassing. Great game if you want to have a family game night. Well, family game night for kids 9+... I suggest to anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch.
Retails at $59.99

What’s in the game?
Violence - Violence is the point of the game, as you brawl against every character for domination. You'll use fists, feet, weapons, objects, special skills to defeat enemies by launching them off the screen. Cartoonish nature and lack of blood and gore lighten impact of gameplay.
Privacy Concerns - Can play with people all around the world.
Sexy Costumes - Some female characters wear skintight costumes.",1
Packed with content that will keep me playing for years to come. Every Switch owner should buy this game,1
"This game is lovely! My 12 year old daughter became very invested in WWII history and this a a great game to feed that fascination. Although there is minimal swearing, the rest of the game was delightful. There was no blood.",1
It isn’t gory and there a excellent role models,1
"Battlefield V, one of the best shooters I have ever played did not happen to fail even the slightest. The action packed shooter leaves explosions going off everywhere you go and always a gunfight to enjoy, but I should be telling you my thoughts on its age rating. So first up this does not at all exceed an M+17 age rating! It is still, I would say recommended for very mature teens as when shot at, soldiers cry in pain bleeding out very realistically on the ground, blood covering the palm of their hands. Yet it seems really the only blood is them moments when you are bleeding out on the floor which can be quickly skipped. Gunfire is quick and blood is almost unnoticeable. Often when on the floor soldiers will shout out swears in whatever country they come from, whether that is in German, British, American whatever language. Most of the swears are quite little and nothing much but rarely the British will shout “f-cking help me!”. The game modes are very tactical and often require a lot of experience which can put the player off the game but it isn’t worth leaving such a good game! The sex is very slight, just some along the side in story missions but they are very little and hardly noticeable jokes. Young audiences can be exposed to online multiplayer game chat, being able to hear random people online which can be an issue but you can easily switch that off in settings no sweat. The Story and Multiplayer game modes show a lot of great messages proving well that you can win anything if you work as a team and I think this game deserves a 12+ rating!",0
Battlefield V is a really fun game set in the WW2 era. It contains a wide variety of game modes and it also has single player missions. You can play as normal infantry control vehicles and fly planes. There isn't an excessive amount of violence but you do see a small spurt of blood when you kill an enemy. Infrequent swearing is also present in the game. Sometimes when you get knocked down your character swears. In the second single player mission there is some frequent swearing so if you don't want your kids to hear that then keep them away from that mission. No dismemberment is present in the game. I would recommend this game to any child over 13 but no younger.,0
"The first thing parents need to know is that common sense is over exagerating. This game should have been givin a T rating, cause its just like Star Wars Battlefront, with great graphics and little gore. When you shoot someone, a small splash of blood will fly up and then dissapear. I think the main problem with this game is the swearing. Unlike COD, theres no option to turn down the language but you can for the violence. The language isint that bad, just the everyday language you hear on the middle school playground. If you heard bad words before and wont use them than this game is FINE. Thank you for taking time to read this review.",1
A GREAT GAME!!!!!! But planes are hard to get in this game.,1
I think its ok for teens and up. Not tweens and kids though.,0
"I am a professional PEGI reviewer. ( I gave this PEGI 16)This game is a must-have for teens. The violence is slightly overstated in the review. There is a very evident bloody spray when enemies are shot. There is a long-lasting blood mist when enemies are sniped. There is brief gore when enemies are shot. The game only shows evident gore when enemies are stabbed. The violence in my opinion is 8.5/10. Games which have this level of violence are Sekiro(8.7/10), the ghost of Tsushima(8.4/10), AC Unity(9/10). There is a great deal of language, f**k, sh*t, hell, damn, bastard, m*therf*cker, c*nt, ass, are all used commonly. The language is 9.6/10.(Worth noting that HARSH language is only used by brits.)
A few games which has this much language is GTA V(10/10), and Gears 5(9.8/10), and not much more. It is worth noting that language is only harsh when playing as a brit.(There is one 10 min war story without around 20 f words!) Language is present when playing as an American and German but the language is not as harsh(s words and b words) and they speak their native tongue. I think that the chaos of the multiplayer and the emotional power of the last tiger war story overshadow some of this mature content. This makes the game perfect for teens, thank you!",0
"Fine for eleven or up, violence blood, language, but language is mainly in the cutscenes which you can skip",0
"It's both educational and fun, and I think should be played by everyone age 9+!",1
"Battlefield 5 is the fifth one in the legendary selling series. But I know you don't care about that, I know why you are here. Is this game violent? Unless you find pg-13 action movies too much for your child then no. Will this desensitize my kid and turn him into a younger version of Osama Bin Laden and or Hitler? Absolutely not, in fact i'm scared if you think that. Do I think this teaches you anything? No I don't, as a person who values historical accuracy and the preservation of history I do not. The story mode for this game is not accurate and ignores obvious facts at one point they attribute the liberation of a town in Norway to one person they don't mention the resistance fighters who fought for it and died they ignore them, to push their own agenda, not to mention the ninja sword and a woman with a prosthetic hook for a hand in the reveal trailer. Do i think that this game is too violent no, do i think this game is going to make you kid into a psycho like the media is trying to say, no i do not. But i am unhappy with the disrespect of history. So if you son/daughter wants this game by all means let them have it, but mention to them that the war stories are not true and are fake, They should find this game fun though, and you will too if you try it and get good at it. The bad language is really basic and your child is gonna be fine assuming that hes 12 and or 11. Plus he/she has most likely defiantly heard it before in the movies. People i have noticed on this site are over praising this game i suggest buying call of duty world at war if your child has a pc and or ps3 or xbox 360. You can read my review on it when you search up Call of Duty World at War.",0
"I have rated this game 15+ for violence and bad language, Violence 4.5/5 you shoot, stab, club and throw grenades to kill enemy players, resulting in puffs of blood as infantry, in vehicles you shoot explosive shots from tanks and can shoot a machine gun, the explosive kills do not have blood or dismemberment but do send people flying, in planes you can drop bombs on people and vehicles but all violence is off screen and you only know that you kill people because of the kill feed. In a cutscene somebody is shot at point blank range with a small puff of blood, you hit somebody's head on a table.
Language 5/5 frequent use of f**k and s**t even online, from your character, and one use of c*nt.",0
"Not historically accurate at all. Represents disabled women fighting in America s frontline which we know is inaccurate. It takes away the realism of previous battle fields to make it “politically correct” and not offend SJWs. As a woman I am proud to play as a man because it was them who fought on the frontlines and woman who did the equally important role of healing them, caring for the children, etc. Also , if EA wanted to be politically correct they could have touched on the great female Russian snipers who killed countless nazis and not have put their own spin on the war and still call it accurate.",0
Easy to play no cussing very good for good for kids to have fun and enjoy a nice entertaining game for kids to have a blast not so much violence,1
"they have a naked magazine in the dad's closet
the dad constantly drinks
the kid tries smoking a cigarette
the dad curses a lot
the dad hits the child",0
"I rated this game 7+ for hard gameplay.
The controls are easy but the game is hard, it gives good messages that you need to work in a team, the king onion reminds you to work together after every world. Buy this game for your kids, it is really good",1
"I think that this game is fine for anyone 14 and up. Definitely not for kids under that, though. The game settings allow you to turn off blood and gore, as my 14 year old showed me, but it is still very violent for immature kids. I also will still not let my kid play zombies, i have watched videos and it looks very intensely violent and gory. I trust my kid with a lot of things but will only let him play Blackout and Multiplayer, definitely no zombies for anyone under at least 16. The game also has lots of bad language but i'm sure that unless you are offended by bad language then it would be fine for 14+. Thanks for reading my opinion!!! I hope it helped.",0
It is not as violent as the reviews say. You can turn of blood gore and language. As long as that is turned off it is no worse than any PG-13 movie. If you are still wary about this game I would suggest watching some one play it. Make sure you watch somebody with blood and language off if you want your kid to have those toggled off.,0
"This game is suitable for ages 12 and up my 13 year old asked me to get this game for him reluctantly i said yes i saw the 18 on the cover and thought it would be to violent. I played the game myself and i seriously rate this game an 18 it is more like a 16, 13 at a push.",0
"I think that this game is fine for teenagers, however if your child is rude or aggressive I think that your kid should wait for this game. You can turn off all of the blood and gore which also blocks out all of the swearing. With this mode on it is a Teen rated game and it just depends on whether your kid is mature enough for this game. It is all about if your kid is able to handle this game without becoming immature.",0
"I bought this game recently even tho the more recent Call of Duty is out (modern warfare remastered). Personally being the dad of four kids 3 boys. My youngest boy is 9 and my oldest is 12. I also have an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. I have been playing video games since the first doom came out and let me tell you games have changed. Anyway, the game is very easy to get right in and my 11-year-old boy I let him play and he loves it I also made sure that it wasn't too bloody or there wasn't too much swearing and it passed. Yes there is a setting to turn of the blood with I think is good but the blood itself is very minor. For the language, there can be the f word or the S word but you can turn off the dialogue but this isn't anything to bad. I do think that if your child starts saying these words you should ake the game away but personally the game isn't that violent a bit if shooting here and there but nothing an 8 year old can handle. Remeber that the title of M rated isn't really that true the blood isn't that bad also you can turn it off the dialogue can be turned off and the community isn't like other games also most people don't even use the microphones. If u think the game is pointless and stupid it isn't, kids will fight together in teams to outsmart the enemy in different tactics trying to capture the objectives and getting new weapons. For money and price, the zombie mode isn't worth buying its really just stupid and not fun also you cant turn off the blood in zombie mode but they look really ugly.",0
"I am a professional PEGI reviewer and rate games on common sense media.org. I noticed that commonsense media consists of many fake parent reviews and I want to start a movement for change. Please check my reviews on popular games, for trustworthy and informative reviews. This game is just like any other call of duty game. Same game every year. There is frequent profanity throughout including f**k, s**t, hell, damn, b*tch, and bastard. language is 8/10. Violence is constant, gore can be turned off. All shots result in some blood and RARELY dismemberment. Blood can barely be seen from far.(sometimes it can't) This game as always will get a 13+.

"This game is really fun, but parents should know that your legs will blow up on a daily basis, and there is excessive blood. If parents don't want their kids playing shooters, then this is not the game for them. However, as an eight year old, I still think older kids would enjoy it. To be honest, the first time I saw the legs blowing up, I got pretty scared. Overall, it's an awesome game!",0
"First, to be clear, you can buy 'digital' download editions of the game from your perspective consoles online store without paying for the physical copies that come with these plastic toys that attach to your controllers. That being said. For Nintendo owners, this is the best Star Fox game to come out since the franchise was first introduced. Personally I prefer the 'on rails' action that of the original, but their integration into Starlink seems to be the answer to the question of how to fix the franchise after so many lackluster attempts and even some outright perplexing flops. This is a free roaming game is all set with you in your ship which is either done between planets as a free roam 'open world' approach or on the ground where movement is fluid but necessarily limited as you do close counter engagements. There is a learning curve, as with every game, to test your limitations, and I have to say, this takes some adept maneuvering if you want to survive battles. Dodging and coordinating your attacks will often be crucial to move forward so this is not a mindless shoot 'em up that just anybody can pick up and start blasting away. For children this means the ability to read direction on a 3rd to 5th grade level especially. Unlike most Star Fox games, Starlink is as much about exploration and building progress over time as it is about action. You can swap weapon loadouts ' on the fly' either in the pause menu or with the toys (that practically nobody is actually buying). WITH the toys,... this has to be covered..., you can take the physical weapons and swap them out on your toy ship which will translate in the game and swap your in game weaponry. This 'sounds cool', but the biggest complaints here are the pricetags for these toys which can easily surpass the actual games initial cost. Plus the fact that many , if not most players, find these toys awkward as they have to be attached ON TOP of your controller in order to function with the game. Some were able to adapt to it, some find it hindering and obstructing to play the game this way. The story itself is well done and ""Disney like"" with the StarFox alliance somewhat shoehorned into the background as add ons, but it all works well enough as a backdrop to the gameplay. Being one of the few titles supporting 2 players local gameplay is a big win though as you can play under the same roof without buying multiple consoles and games, you only need 2 controllers and a single TV. With the same moralities and tone of your typical nintendo fare, this is a child friendly PG to PG 13 kind of game. Nothing over the top in violence but refined and responsive enough to surpass it's cartoon looks and be engaging with a good amount of depth. The ships are satisfyingly maneuverable and familiar for Star Fox fans and the various weapons interesting to experiment with, along with some speed and thrusting capabilities that are satisfying and efficient in covering more ground. Be prepared to go on side quests and farming exspeditions at times with many traveling departures that take some chunks of time to get through but can be fast traveled later. Although i have seen and been old these toys are DOA and not selling hardly at all, the game itself to me is somewhat of a pacifier. I wouldn't have dropped 60 bucks on it if I had it to do over as i think its actual worth is about 40, but for those who have longed for a good action space exploration game especially a Star Fox one. This is probably the best you are going to get for a long while.",1
I have played this cute little game and my 10 yr old daughter loves this game. Its just a cute platform game for VR.,1
"Game plays well and I can see it being very popular with preteen gamers.
Its 1st person and slightly more graphical than fortnight but concept it very similar (be last alive).
I have seen very little gore and game language seems to be very tame.
Something to consider for under 13s.
If you play solo or in a group of 2 you are forced into a group of 3 so 1 or 2 strangers.
In most rounds I played (solo) the 2 random players did not have mics or was tame with there chat but I have had games where I have had abuse and some very vulgar language used towards me.
I'm sure there is a mute function in game but tbh I have not looked as I just ignored them ( on ps4 entering private party chat alone or with friend will mute other players in game group)
With the above said being my only concern that I have found I would happily let my 10 year old play but only with random players muted.
You know your kids best I would say prob 12+ on this game but my 10 year old is mature for 10.",0
"This game is very good, it is appropriate to teens. There are possitive messages because this game focuses on team work. These characters are mostly good, but some have bad backstories. The game is pretty easy to play, but there is a lot of violence, due to the game being about a a battle royale. The language used by characters is fine, but online chat can lead to other people using bad language. You can also buy online currency to buy skins. There is some drug use, because when you heal up, you use some kind of syringe that inyects some kind of healing liquid. I don't know if that counts as drug use.",0
"This game has seemingly replaced Fortnite in popularity, as I’ve noticed my son and his carpool switch the subject of their lengthy conversations to Apex Legends. I was hesitant at first, because the game is a branch off of the violent EA shooter Titanfall. When I saw the word “blood” in the MPAA rating, as well as CSM’s review, I was almost about to tell my 11 year old ‘no’.
However, after watching several YouTube videos and reading abou the game, I saw a different side of things. The “blood” is short lasting, just a faint mist of red when using heavy weapons. There is no foul language unless your child’s teammates cuss, but voice chat can be toggled on/off in the settings. The fact that there is no sexual content in this game makes it even safer for kids. The closest thing to drugs and alcohol I could find was when the character pulls out a high tech syringe-type thing and (out-of-view) uses it to gain “health points” and heal. The game doesn’t really encourage any positive messages, but good teamwork will often result in winning the game, which is survival-style, and one elimination will keep you out for the rest of the match. My son, 11 years old, struggles to keep up with the fast paced action in the game, which seems to give him a disadvantage when it comes to escaping enemy fire. I don’t believe it to be any more addicting to kids then Fortnite, and with less bizarre dances and more action, it probably won’t have the uniqueness to remain a popular game for long.",1
Parents should let their kids play this! It has little gore and improves their team building through coordination with teammates. This game has a great time setting that the whole family should enjoy! Get your kid this game for a team building game!,1
I watch my son play this game and it is not all that violent sure you use guns but it is encouraging teamwork and communication to win. The blood is very minimal and it only shows up for about 2 seconds.,1
"It’s got a similar setup to call of duty but it’s really cartoonishly made and really similar to fortnite if you’re the parent of a ten or eleven year old you should probably let them play this game. there is one problem the voice chat, if you child can’t handle bad late e then I would recommed not getting this game because if your playing online with of kids or young adults the voice chat lets you curse sooooo! they can handle it, or do you not trust your child?!",1
"I have personally played Apex Legends, I think it is a fun game, but i would not recommend it for kids under 10 years old, simply because there is violence and sometimes people can be rude in the voice chat, but for the most part, people are nice enough and just want to play the game.",0
"Apex Legends is the next big thing in Battle Royal. Could it be the one to dethrone Fortnight? Possibly, it's definitely on track to surpass it. I feel there are a few things that hold Apex back from being the lone survivor in this battle royal.
1: Squads only - I love squads when I'm playing with people I know however when I am paired with randoms the fun is taken down a notch. That is due to a number of factors. Lack of communication being the main one. That one issue in turn leads to the other issues such as landing spot, respawning, etc. If they allowed a Duos or Solo mode I feel that could go a long way in boosting the game.
2: Weapon/Loot Spawns - It is definitely feast or famine when it comes to weapons and attachments/items. Even in the ""High Tier Loot"" sections it can be pretty barren unless you luck up. Many times you should expect to find a handgun of some form. Maybe an SMG if you are lucky. However the hand guns in this game are not much more than a placeholder or decoration as they don't do enough damage to keep you alive long(unless you come upon a poor soul who missed out on the initial landing grabfest). Randomness is to be expected but I feel they could drop a few more guns to start off with. Otherwise you could be in for a short game.
3: Ammo and lack thereof - The damage the guns put out isn't great and with shields/armor and bullet drop off it can be extremely difficult to down an opponent. Many times you'll find yourself with plenty of ammo for a gun you don't have or find the gun you want but ammo is nowhere to be found. Sure the game isn't supposed to be simple but when you have a gun but no ammo or it, it kind of takes away from the fun part.
4: Hit detection - Some hero's attract more bullets than others. Gibralter for instance is a sponge due to his size but a smaller legend like Lifeline is harder to hit. They are currently working on hit detection so this one should be fixed soon.
That being said the positive outweighs the negative. You don't HAVE to spend real money to have fun. The skins are all purely cosmetic and do not change the game. Now while this game has a nice community we all know that once it gets more popular it will become more toxic with bullies and foul people. I'd say kids 12 and older would be fine on the game. Anyone younger would find some of the nuances of the game slightly difficult and due to the random people you get teamed with you might have the occasional creep so play with discernment.",0
My son loved this game it is for parents who's son is addicted to fortnite,1
"Graphical Content: There is shooting involved/bullets, in a more realistic manner than Fortnite. However, I wouldn't call it overtly violent - there is no gore, actual blood that I've noticed, no brutal executions etc. No sexual content, drug use, nudity.
Gameplay: Gameplay is enjoyable, I would say its a bit more team-focused than Fortnite. As of now you must be in a squad of 3 players every time you play, either with friends you know or the game will matchmake with other people. Vocal communication is a key part of securing victory within the game - Children may be exposed to unsuitable language in this case, but not more so than other online games. Playing with their friends would be advisable if this is a worry.
Game is a bit more difficult than Fortnite I would say, there is no building aspect so you are forced to find cover rather than make it. There are also skills unique to each character ""Legend"" which are also a key part to winning games. Knowing when to use skills to support the team and also yourself is important and takes some time to learn. However, I wouldn't say its an overly difficult game to learn - kids who have played Fortnite should jump into it with relative ease.",0
This game is extremely fun and like fortnite except with a more succour voice chat systeam,1
It is so good and it should be ok for 7 years old And there’s not much blood and it is good tho teach kids to work as a team but some people on voice chat can swear but you can mute them so you can not hear them by pressing the button when you are choosing your legend.,1
"In Apex Legends, players are put into teams of three (all users can communicate with each other through voice chat) and fight to be the last team standing. In order to survive, players must use any assortment of weapons, including guns, knives, fire, explosives, and gas. There is no gore except for blood splatter effects and minor blood stains.
Most characters have positive goals and backgrounds. However, one character is a mad scientist who loves to watch his victims suffocate to death, but he’s explicitly marked as “not a hero”. Some characters say minor curses, such as “hell” and “damn”.
Also consider that players can communicate through voice chat, which isn’t filtered. However, you can turn this into text, which is censored.",0
"It is a game that involves strategy, team work, and focus this game is good for 8 and up",1
We allowed our 8 year old to play and found text messages from some stranger! We obviously are done with spec and ps5 for a while! Predators have no shame! I hate this world! My fail!,0
"This game was very disappointing . The story line is boring, the amount of content isn't too much, overall not that great. Cleavage is shown but too much, and the violence is slightly raised from doa5. the DLC isn't all that cool (Mai was in doa5 so nothing new, and Kula is interesting but doesn't really fit that much in the game in my opnion). Then again the game is fan service and wasn't really made to be played very competitively. The costumes are very expensive, and the extra things that ""offer a better experience"" are way to much. doa5 was much, much better. I would only recommend the game to people who can spend lots of money and who are new to the series. Besides that the gameplay is similar to previous titles. However, there is a chance team ninja and Tecmo will release a remake of the game making it better like they did with doa5.",0
"Pode is a great game for kids, with relatively easy controls.
Both characters play on the same screen and help each other to solve puzzles.
Although I think the game is certainly suitable for age 6 or 7 up, the puzzles do get progressively harder.
We are half way through the game and my 6 and 9 year old play it together with the 9 year old able to work out the puzzles so far and help direct the 6 year old. My 6 year old has needed help with the controller timing some jumps.
It's a really sweet game with a lot of character to it. Its a lot of fun and my kids have been really happy playing the game, giggling between themselves when making the characters doing silly things.
It's good for learning, with a lot of thinking about how the characters use their own abilities to solve different parts of each puzzle.",1
Its not appropriate for kids what so ever its disgusting an revolting as u beat the life out of creatures and the gameplay is not enjoyable and is just plain broken its not scary its just sick and not in a good way,0
"SEX/NUDITY - None. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are scenes of disturbing horror violence as the player fights grotesque creatures with a variety of weapons. However, these scenes lack the goriest and most graphic detail due to the top-down camera angle and art style. There are also some bloody images and implications of violent incidents. PROFANITY - There is some strong language (""f*ck""), as well as instances of milder terms. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There are plenty of drug references and alcohol references throughout, both visual and verbal. The player is also encouraged to create medicinal drugs for health boosts etc. Although, these are never or rarely used in recreational or stimulating ways, and the game as a whole does not encourage drugs in the real world. THREAT/HORROR - The game contains a constant, sustained sense of threat and menace, made more unsettling and disturbing by the psychological horror elements throughout gameplay. Although being relatively low on explicit gory images, this is still a very intense and surreal experience, with frequent frightening moments which might cause upset to people of a nervous disposition.
15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.",0
"I have 2 young boys, and they both take turns playing this game. It is fun and interactive, and violence is minimal for a star wars game, with emphasis on puzzle solving. Additionaly, it tells an empowering story for kids about being strong in the face of opression. As long as you trust your kid, this is a great buy!",1
"No idea what PEGI were smoking when this got a 16. It is quite obviously very similar to a Star Wars film, so if your kids are up for those then this is a walk in the park. Violence is minimal and 'justifiable', ie much less than the likes of Fortnite. Graphics in 4K on Xbox One X are very lifelike, but not in a frightening way. Gameplay is immersive and based on problem solving, also quite slow in its pace so prevents the aggression that other games can give rise to. Didn't see any bad real world behaviours or swearing. Nothing to worry about here mums and dads :-)",1
Great Game... Age rating by PEGI and other companies does not suit this game. Adventure and fun only!. No Swears and Definitely Age Appropriate for Children... I'd say 10+,1
"Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the best Star Wars games to date. The exploration is fun, the combat is exciting and often challenging (yet not an annoyance), the main characters are likeable and portrayed very well, and even the music is excellent. My only criticism is that backtracking to collect crates that were previously unattainable is rather tedious and irritating, especially when they're located in the middle of a maze of forgettable turns and tunnels, although I understand that this is designed to provide the player with a challenge. But none the less, it did put me off trying to 100% the game. In addition, some of the game's puzzles are confusing and difficult, but eventually manageable with some luck or an online guide. Or maybe I'm just not very good, I don't know. All things considered though, Jedi: Fallen Order is an excellent game and a shining example of a good, micro-transaction free, single-player experience. 8.7/10.",1
"This game is absolutely great. The story is simplistic and VERY starwars! There is no swearing and profanity, no sexual content and immodesty. You can tell that the characters within are learning and changing to become better. Jedi are good rolemodels.
However, I think that this game will blow over the heads of younger kids through its design, which requires a sensitivity to timing and rhythm. Button mashing will not help you in this game. While there is no blood/ gore, the violence can be over the top, as the lightsaber can cut many creatures in half. There also are a few dark scenes in which the protagonist must overcome his inner rage and past tragedy.
Very good game!",1
It is a great game for kids 8 and up it has no swearing and is fun and easy to play not to mention that cal is a great role model.,1
"I loved this game, good story, characters. A Star Wars fan like myself would give this 5 stars. I only gave it 4 because someone who isn't into that storyline might not understand/appreciate it. The characters are absolutely fantastic, and really make it much better. Lots of references to other movies/shows. There is some typical staff wars action, blasters and sabers. And some animal dismemberment (no blood).",1
"To parents
This is an amazing game, for the price might be a little high, but it is EA who made it so, toughen up buttercup! Amazing graphics, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but I was let down a little bit.",1
"I was enthralled with this one. It had a great story and amazing characters. The violence is not too bad. You do slice some enemies, but there is absolutely no dismemberment or cutting off (aside from slicing some spiders in half.) Very very little language if any at all, aside from a few ""Damns and Hells."" The game can be a bit dark and challenging especially on the Dathomir planet. But overall, this is a fantastic game. Highly recommend it for your Star Wars fan in the family. Well done EA and Respawn.",1
"Some people might say this game is rated Teen. It's still very appropriate for even eight and up. However, to fully appreciate and understand the game I think they should be at least ten years old. There is a little more than average of violence but most kids can handle it. Also, the story sends the message of not hiding and being your true self.",1
"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a science fiction action/adventure game available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Windows-based PCs. The game's set within the expansive Star Wars universe, shortly after the events of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Players take on the role of a young fugitive Jedi on a quest to try to rebuild and restore the Jedi Order. Action is constant, with frequent killing shown onscreen and some intense moments of violence in cutscenes, though no blood or graphic gore's shown. The game emphasizes timing in combat and presents a relatively high degree of challenge, especially at higher difficulty levels. The word ""bastard"" is heard in some dialogue.",1
"This game is incredibly hard to learn and can be unforgiving unless you have someone to help you learn to play. That being said once you have gotten through and have the basics down it is a blast and one that never gets old. I must have hundreds of hours in this game by now and despite being rounds of the same game over and over again with updates being semi regular the combinations that build that game keep it constantly fresh and engaging.
This game is in a top down zoomed out view so the characters remain visually distant meaning any 'sexualisation' of characters of which there is already so little is negated by the visual style of the game.
The violence is also minimised from this view and is all fantasy making it no worse than the simplest of games. This is especially true when you can turn off the violence and blood in the settings.
The biggest downside was the communities response to bad or new players as they could sometime be a little abusive and very lacking in sympathy with bad language. This was no more common however than people who were incredibly kind and when you let people know you are knew they are often nice enough to talk you through what is going on and help you out. In fact I have had a couple of experiences where a player has reached out to play a few games together where they have walked me through and coached me in the basics. There is also an easy work around to the language as they have recently added a profanity filter and you can also disable chat for your child if they are at the younger ages. You can also entirely avoid the risks and simply have your child play offline matches with AI so that they can learn the game in a more predictable and easier setting.
All in all DoTA is a complex, satisfying and hugely enjoyable game that's few issues around violence and profanity in the community can all be worked around and these things continue to be a main focus of the company currently so they will only get better.",0
"This game is good for teens. You start as an ape, the goal of this game is to evolve and become a modern human. The game starts in the jungles of Africa 10 million years ago. You have a clan and you can lead them, also you have to gather materials, resources, and food to survive. There are predators and animals that you have to watch out for in the jungles.",1
"When my ten-year-old first asked for this game, I was skeptical. Sure, this game looked tame enough, but I wasn’t sure if he would have access to the main game. After some consideration, I purchased it, but I played some of it before giving it to him. I was astonished by the detail and educational content in this game. There were lessons and tests, and my son would frequently run up to me with new facts about the Ancient Greek world to share. Even though there is a collection of lessons about Ancient Greek battles, it was presented as flags with various symbols on them. If you are concerned about nudity or sex, the game has nude statues, but nothing is sexualized or graphic. This made my child eager to learn and to explore the fascinating world of Ancient Greece. I would rate this game a 6/5 if I could; it’s just so phenomenal. I hope this review helped you.
P.S. This game has some vocabulary your children might not understand. Just be aware that your child may need to be a little sophisticated.",1
"Wanted to note that my 9 yr old played for about 30 mins before he discovered to his simultaneous delight and horror that he could kill NPCs by crashing a boat into an NPCs boat, leaving their corpse floating in the sea. Something to be aware of.",0
This is a really great program. It takes kids through lots of mini-games that teach them about the moves of each different chess piece -- even some strategy! I had never played Chess when my 6-year old became interested. This game taught me enough to keep up with him!,1
I love this game and i want to play it now online.,1
"My second favorite Mario Party game (original N64 game in first). Wonderful for slumber parties. I'm a relaxed parent, but some of my kid's friend's parents aren't, so when they come over they can play this without concern. A must-have for those who have slumber parties a lot, along with all other MP games.",1
"Whenever my 10 year old kid has a slumber party this is the first thing that he plays with the guests. It's a great game for when you have a lot of kids around. I myself play it all the time. I probably shouldn't be doing this, but if I find myself waking up at 3 AM, I play Mario Party 4. Great game.",1
Its a family game. Big siblings and play with littler siblings. Its a game that even the grandparents can play and understand.,1
this game...i was playing with my little sister. theres nothing wrong with this game.,1
"You get an open slate of where you want to place stuff to see how your city grows. You have to balance a budget of not spending more than you take in (personal finance).
The only down side to this is that the game can be addictive. You can't not spend hours in front of the screen to build up a complex city.",1
Really Good! There's Nothing bad for kids!,1
"I bought simcity 4 and simcity 4 deluxe for my son he likes them both. It tought him about monthly
income and expenses, and that it's hard to earn money in a fun way. You can teach this game yourself after a few weeks",1
"Great soundtrack, and emphasizes on importance of strategy. Also brings economics into the picture and teaches the importance of having both a military as well as an economy to support it, for ""an army marches on its stomach, or so the old saying goes"" :D
Also got me interested in learning about the various characters and heroes portrayed in the game as well as their roles in history (Frederick Barbarossa, Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, Saladin, El Cid, Montezuma, etc) and teaches history quite well. It also manages to follow history (for the most part) and is not too hard for even a beginner player.",1
"Strong points: great music, straightforward controls and gameplay, provokes curiosity about history, various civilizations cater to different gaming styles while still having the same fundamentals
Weak points: With the MSN Gaming Zone offline, online matches are difficult to coordinate.",1
"Although the object is to build a society my child uses it to conquer enemies. When people are killed they turn into small skeletons and then disappear after a few minutes. At first I was completely opposed to the game but feel that overall it is a strategic game with less violence than most Saturday morning cartoon shows.
My child is 9.",0
"This is somewhat challenging game, involving numerous amounts of strategy and reading. This game simulates historic battles and characters, such as Joan of Arc, Ghengis Kahn and Henry V very accurately. I personally never knew how a trebuchet worked until I played this game. This game involves a lot of strategy, and offers a multitude of storylines. If youre looking for a wonderful multiplayer strategy game this is it. There are few games that come close to the level of strategy needed for this game. As far as its multiplayer ability is concerned, it is wonderful, probably the best.",1
"...I enjoy playing it, and the expansion makes is more fun. But I will not play it with my children in the room (they are 2 and 5). Although the violence is seen from far away, we had one instance when our 5 year old became upset when the villagers killed an animal while hunting. (Like they say, Know Your Kids!) As for educational value, it's okay... as a teacher, I find it minimal, but may be the only way to get some kids to actually get involved in what actually happened! Use only as support, though, to actual teaching. It does, however, help teach budgeting (spending resources on growth), as well as painting a picture of the work involved in setting up a functioning society.",1
"I think this is the best final fantasy game I have ever played.
The only thing I did not like of it, is there are some characters revealing skin, no nudity, there is mage that shows some skin around the chest, and it stops right at the end, nothing shown really close though.
There also is a person who you fight towards the end of the game, she is wearing a bikini pretty much, its worse then a bikini, so you might want to watch out for that.
As for language, there is just d words scattered around the game.
This game gives a positive message, to stand up for yourself and do what you want to do, not what everyone else wants you to do.
Best final fantasy game I ever played. I recommend this for 13 and older, no under.",0
It’s great until you need to accomplish certain minigames to unlock items. The minigames are extremely difficult and aren’t even based on skill they’re based on luck and RNG. Why design a minigame that ruins the actual game? Great until the end.,1
"Okay, this game could be played by someone as young as 11 years old - the violence is not gory at all, except maybe the appearance of aeon (sort of god that you can summon) Anima is bit ""gory"" as i think its depiction of suffering soul full of hate and sorrow.
But yeah nothing too bad that 11 year could not play it in theory, but then again i think the story and world of final fantasy in general is leaning more towards older teens/adults, i think a kid would get way more out of this game if they played it later in life (14+) than too early.
Even though the graphics are better, i feel that this is overall less gory than for example Final Fantasy 7 which had some very dark moments which Jenova facility etc, and the story in my opinion was geared for adults. If there was a FF that would be a kid friendly and still good, it would probably be this one FFX.",0
"Final Fantasy X boasts incredible graphics for its time, well designed characters with fulfilling arcs, an engrossing world and lore, and gameplay that is among the best in the series.
Some of the themes and the nature of Spira isn’t necessarily made for children, and they likely won’t enjoy the cutscenes, or the late-game difficulty, but it is definitely worth a look to all FF fans, and RPG fans alike.",1
This game shows alot of sub titles. I was surprised to see my son who doesnt like to read start reading because he liked this game. The characters are very likable. There is no sexual content. Cartoony violence is no less violent then ninja turtles and batman. My son asked a lot of questions while playing this game such as what is fayth. I had hard time understanding that Tidus was fayth’s dream but my son seem to understand it much better. He understood that Titus had to disappear because fayth would no longer dream when yu yevon was vanquished. I was vey suprised that kids so young had so much vivid imagination and can understand complex story plot.,1
My son enjoyed this game. He understood the storyline very well. He liked hunting monsters and liked gathering summons. His favorite part of the game was when Yuna got her Megus sisters.,1
"This game is great. The story is impeccable and you can play for hours. There is only one kissing scene that may be inappropriate for an 8 year old and there is average FF violence. The main character dad was called drunkard and that is the only drinking reference. There were only like 2 swears, but it's not very bad (they use ""damnation"" and ""damn"" only). I got very attached to the game but kids who don't like a good story wouldn't be interested.",0
"Take my word for this! This is an exceptional Final Fantasy although it is the most intense game I have played if you are not counting Xenosaga I and II. The violence is VERY strong in this game although there is no blood except in 2 scenes and the rest of the game is bloodless violence. The language is not an issue although the word damn and hell is used somewhat frequently. There are some sexual scenes but nothing stronger than 7+ for that. The story is very, very intense. It may be extremely upsetting for people under 15 and then ending is VERY!!!!!!!!!!!! sad. Basically, 14+ for the content and 16+ for the story unless you can handle intense, sad, and actually quite frightening!
SPOILERS
Later in the game, you see the main enemy send a hole right through the centre of the Earth, and sends a HUGE tidal wive at 7+ people. Then a * shape comes out of the hole he made and sends major eruptions of flame come out of the Earth and wrap around the world. People from villages watch and screm as the 1,000,000,000,000,000 lbs+ creature falls from the sky and lands on the ground causing a 10 richter scale Earthquake. That is the most frightening scene in the game!",0
"This game is pretty good. The game was more girly than the original but hey they make up for it. The battle system is worse that X-1 but I'm not complainingg. We miss the sphere grid, but levels make the game much faster. The violence is what you would expect from final fantasy (you clunk the enemy on the head and eventually passes away). Now I would say a girl could play this at any age. But guys like me and my friends are another story. Well if the boy is inbetween 2 (hey I started then) and 10 would probably think the girls' clothing is odd, but someone 11+ will uhhhh..... you know..... enjoy their outfits more..... getting older has pluses..... lets just say that the clothing was a thing guys helped with. Enjoyable game.",0
"Scantily-clad girls kick monster butt. I'm not a big YRP fan, but it is a good game. Like most every RPG Square Enix pulls out, it's a good, solid RPG. The only real iffy things are the violence (without bloodshed) and the dress-up system. Like the Sphere-Grid system in FFX, it confused the heck outta me. ^^; The thing turning me off to this game is the YRP factor. Dressing the girls up in cute costumes is fun, but a little degrading for a girl like me to see those tiny outfits. o.o Definitely geared towards boys, but it's still a solid RPG. If you wanna waste 40+ hours of your life, please do pick up this game. It's worth the waste. ^_^",0
"In the Half Life series, you are a scientist who is removed from a stasis and forced to fight against an alien government by a mysterious employer. The violence is just alien blood and zombies. There are a few jumpscares here and there, but other than that it is not scary. One thing though are the dead bodies, however they are not there to be gross; they're there to convey how evil this empire is. If your kid is still afraid of the bogeyman, it's not for them.
Also, there are many positive roll models- the main character, Gordon, and various allies and sidekick Alyx Vance, are all focused on liberty for humans.",0
I played this game when I was 10 and I found some of it quite bloody. It isn't too violent if you are mature and there isn't an excessive amount of swearing.,0
"I personally think that this is a really fun game and is one of the best that I’ve ever played in my life. However, this game also has some mature content kids shouldn’t see like: blood, guns, gore and some other really cruel things like burnt bodies so I do not suggest kids should play this.",0
"This game contains blood, violence and some scary moments.The first time i played it i was 13 years old.I didn't get scared.The only time i got scared was in ravenholm's cemetery.Creepy sounds and a lot of zombies! It is a very nice game for grown kids though. The world design is super awesome, the story is very beautiful.Graphics are still decent.The langouage is kid friendly",0
I played this game since I was young and my little brother who's 12 played it and loves it since Im going to college I gave him my game and he won't stop playing it 10/10,1
"I remember watching my dad play this game when it first came out and I was still in grade school; and while I don't remember being disturbed by it, that's only because I didn't see the whole thing.
Violence: plenty of gunfights between human combatants, with successful hits producing large plumes of blood, and cries of pain. Most of the enemies the player fights are Storm Trooper-esque soldiers covered from head to toe in dark body armor, which slightly diminishes the effect of the violence. Still, the allied forces the player fights alongside are normal looking humans, and they are subjected to the same kind of violence. attacks leave bloody wounds on characters where they were hit, which not only makes the violence feel more realistic, but can also lead to some grisly looking scenes which were completely unscripted. (I.E, an ally who was hit in the head during a battle now has a bloody gash covering one side of their face, but they still make eye contact with the player when talking to them, forcing you to stare at it). Several encounters can result in people being set on fire. The player does battle with several types of hostile aliens, which all produce yellow blood when injured. Some of these alien enemies are enormous insects, which can be blown to pieces. The most upsetting type of enemy the player encounters are zombies, who come in several deformed varieties. The most common type has torn open torsos, which expose their lungs and intestinal systems. Others variants are either bloated with dark black skin, or simply no skin at all, revealing their muscular systems. Zombies can be sliced in half, sometimes their torsos will keep moving.
Several environments are littered with mostly burned dead bodies.
Upsetting/Scary themes:
The Game is set in a dystopian future where an alien force has occupied earth and established a totalitarian regime. In the opening chapters of the game, we see several examples of their cruelty, their human peacekeepers are portrayed interrogating, beating, and generally abusing the populace, emulating atrocities seen in real dictatorships. Citizens are portrayed as being in emotional agony, some sequences depict oppressed citizens crying and begging for this torment to end. In a few scenes we see people screaming for help at the sight of the murder or abuse of their loved ones.
One specific portion of the game is set in a zombie infested city, with hoards of the creatures attacking the player constantly. The aforementioned zombies will scream ""Oh God"" over and over again when set on fire, implying their humanity is still there, and feeling all of the pain you give them.
Positive messages/role models: The story portrays a rebellion against an oppressive government, with strong themes of human spirit and passion overpowering greed and corruption. Intelligence is praised, with many of the game's heroes, including the player being former scientists who use their knowledge to solve the problems they are faced with. The cast is somewhat diverse, with several African American and female Main characters.",0
I do not recommend playing at a young age because it may scare younger children I started playing at age 9 though but lets get to the game now It has one of the best stories i've ever experienced and stunning graphics for its time and suitable for low quality computers,0
"I have been playing Half-Life and its series for years. I find its an amazing storyline, amazing well thought out characters and enemies. Its not at all over sexual or violent. Yes there is blood and death in the game but nothing like alot of these other FPS games portray. Yea there are dead bodies in the game but there are in other games as well and you don't see people getting all butthurt about it. I suggest if your child over 13 is scared over these game series its time to sit them down and explain its NOT real. Really tired of Half-Life getting such a bad rap!",0
"This game is a classic, its a beautiful game with what were at the time groundbreaking graphics. The most gore yo experience in this game is the zombies witch have blood stained shirts, in certain sections you can also find bones. Its an FPS so their is a lot of violence, the violence isn't intensive though and is interrupted by frequent puzzles.",0
"Largely identical to Half Life 1s gameplay but with more physics based gameplay and level variety and grander scope. So in other words great. No room or encounter in any level feels the same at all (save for the end game but its justified in context). So many twists in gameplay are constantly come into play and it all feels terrific and intense while moving at a crisp pace save for an overlong boat chase segment. Not a good story like many people say. Its just a basic messianic fight the aliens story with zero character development for its 2 dimensional albiet loveable characters. Zombies feel forced but they make for some very fun gameplay. Now the worldbuilding, atmospheric immersion, and point to point plot is very engaging. Even if its not quite as natural or taut as HL1.
Gameplay is not extrordinarily gory but has quite alot of blood splat on walls depending in weapon when fighting combine. Many environments have bloody, gory, rotting, deformed bodies lying around. Zombies are hideous and gory looking. Zombies wail disturbingly when on fire. They can be cut in half and decapitated. Ravenholm has gruesome imagery abound. Very dated graphics. 1 or 2 very easy to miss f words, one of which is cut off by crash on PC version (audible in Orange Box)",0
"Way too Gory and Too violent.
Very sacrilegious even the priest in this game kills zombies.
This game is evil.
Do not waste your money nor time please. It is way way to insanely violent.",0
"The hippogriff ride is too difficult for anyone, so don't tell your kids to finish the challenge before you buy the next game in the series. I'm 20 and I couldn't do it.",0
Madden 2005 is the most realistic football game there is. This has more physical emotion when they get hurt and it's more creative because the new option lets you create your own fan to be just like how you want to have them.,1
"This is just a great game, no doubt about it. I love playing this game after just winning a Mauraders Football game. I just love lowering the big hit and a catching a 80 yard pass. This is a great game!!!!",1
"This game is the most played game we own--in fact, my kids would rather play this game than watch TV. We started with the first Backyard Baseball and have owned every version released for both the PC and the Playstation 2. All three boys (ages 5,7 &amp; 9) create their own fantasy teams (including creating themselves as players), play seasons, discuss strategy. They play alone and together. This game is worth every penny for playability and good clean fun.",1
"Our son, 9, loves this game, as do our neighbor's boys, ages 5,7, and 10. The graphics are relatively unsophisticated, but the kids don't seem to mind. Until my son's team made it to the World Series (and won it, of course) all other games were forgotten. We limit him to one hour of computer per day, and now that he's got the hang of it, he's able to play an entire game in that time. To us this is a huge plus -- less fuss when time's up. The game reinforces fundamental baseball rules and introduces some strategy.",1
"It's easy for adults to play, but still a lot of fun. The graphics are good, and the sound effects are neat.",1
educational and amusing...not a bad combination!,1
Kids will have a good time with this!,1
"My granddaughter was 2 yrs when she received her very Own Leap for her birthday from TARC, She is autistic - blind an several other disabilities, She is now going on 13 an this little green Frog or Cookie as she calls him has been the best friend an learning toy she ever had, And Its been the hardest to find. Never realized I should of stocked up when he was around cuz tell this day that the one toy that brings her comfort though the good n bad days ..... I just wish it was a little easier to get.",1
This is my daughter's favorite Christmas toy...always the first thing she goes for. She gets excited when she hears her and her family members names said by Leap! We cannot wait to get some of the cartridges that go with it.,1
"Awsome, you gotta play it especially if you like to run tycoon games!",1
"I'm quite surprised the viewer failed to mention the underlying themes of the game. Bioshock is unbdoubtably gratuitously violent, but it is not without educational value. While I don't think its necessary healthy for immature players, Bioshock has a convoluted, character driven colorful story depicting a would-be-Randion utopia gone horribly wrong. The game was meant to be a critique of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, with Andrew Ryan representing Rand's ideas and her character of John Galt. The game explains the political contexts of Marxist revolution and government economic intervention that motivated self-made entrapenur Andrew Ryan to construct a hidden laisezz-faire capitalist utopia for individualists concealed from the ""parasitic"" societies on the surface which have the power to destroy anything they don't like with nuclear weapons. However, Ryan's philosophy of unfettered markets without regulation runs amok when bio-modification is introduced, leading to the degradation and collapse of his society. Even emergency medical care costs money in Bioshock, and the complete lack of regulation led to the insanity and violent mutation of so-called ""Rapture""'s citizens, leaving Ryan a pitiful recluse who violently takes out his anger in vain on his former compatriots. The game leaves much potential intellectual discussion, what brought down Rapture, was it Ryan's (or rather Rand's) laissez-faire egoist philosophy, or was it the irresponsibility of some of its citizens? Is Bioshock an accurate critique of Rand's objectivist philosophy, could something like this happen with the introduction of genetic engineering to madly-consumer driven society? The game also makes references to eugenics. The Reviewer also fails to note the heartwarming ending of the game if the player follows a moral path, an ending where he find's something he never had. I will admit the unecessary and slasher flick level of violence detracts from the positive aspects as it takes attention off the story, and while I'm not the least bit squeamish, I think the game could have been more down to earth with a more realistic level of violence rather than the ridiculously over the top bloodshed it has. Bioshock is an extremely violent and moderately explicit game, but if one is mature enough to wade through it for the story's sake, they can find an intriguing ethical thriller.",0
"Despite BioShock's M+ ESRB rating, commonsensemedia's 18+ is a little overkill. Of course BioShock is violent--like most first person shooters, enemies are defeated in spurts of blood and accompanied with gruesome sound effects. You have access to a wide array of weapons, including a wrench, a shotgun, a crossbow and more, as well as special powers you can equip, such as the abilities to kill your enemies with magical bursts of fire or electricity. BioShock's general tone is dark and nerve-wracking, not to mention claustrophobic: its entire premise revolves around your character trying to escape an underwater hell crawling with wrench-wielding enemies, powerful robots and creepy girls called Little Sisters. Advertisements across the locations have slight sexual overtones--an advertisement to a strip club called Eve's Garden titled ""Come bit the apple!"" and showing a naked woman with strategically placed hair. You can visit the strip club in-game but its insides are deserted except for a disemboweled stripper. Your character is able to pick up cigarettes and alcohol to the point of intoxication (your screen is blurry for a few seconds) and you'll hear several F-Bombs. Age aside, BioShock is a well-made game with stunning and immersive graphics, a unique storyline and engaging gameplay. It's a great experience for those mature enough to play it.",0
great game! there may be a tiny bit of language but overall its fine.,1
"In my opinion, BioShock is what we should be basing our society on. It takes place in an underwater city that is falling apart, and our protagonist, Jack Ryan, comes in and saves the day. He singlehandedly transforms this once decrepit city into a glorious pillar of civilization... If you make the right decisions in life. If you SAVE the Little Sisters, then they come to your rescue when you need them (thereby teaching children ""The Golden Rule"") and you see them caring for you and being good citizens in the closing cinematic. If you make the wrong choices, however, you see your demise at the hands of the people you were annihilating earlier. This game goes to prove that if you do what is right, you will benefit in life, and if not, you will suffer in life. Now some may argue that this game is ""inappropriate"" or ""bad"" because of a few things. I would like to stop those rumors right now. First off, the game is not ""bad"" just because it has cigarettes and alcohol as consumable products. The game is set in the 1960's, when it was socially and medically acceptable to smoke and drink to your heart's content. Saying this game is ""bad"" because of that would be like saying a rated E10 game set in the 1820's is ""bad"" because they reference slavery. And smoking and drinking have adverse effects on the player. Cigarettes take away a good portion of your health, warning you that if you continue on this path, you WILL die quickly. Alcohol makes the screen shift rapidly, thus leaving you open to attack, showing the dangers of being inebriated. Second, some people would say that this game is overly gory, but, in actuality, there is a very reasonable reason it would seem like that. Rapture, the underwater city the game is set in, is around 200 leagues under the sea, which, as any SCUBA diver will tell you, will create a lot of pressure. The citizens of Rapture are being subjected to TONS of pressure, and are without any kind of pressure regulating apparatus. Being such, of course this phenomenon occurs, and the citizens can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it! Saying this is overly gory is like saying a hemophiliac with a laceration is overly gory because they won't stop bleeding. Third, people say that being able to ""dispose"" of the Little Sisters is inhumane. I say, one, this is a choice, and not exactly an optimum one. This game teaches the importance of life and helping people. If you choose to rescue enough Little Sisters, they, being the kind children they are, decide to leave you a gift, full of much more ADAM than you would get by disposing of them. This is a great game!",0
"This game is for older kids, but then agian, it depends on the family. The violence is bad, but it's not much of an issue in my family. This game is art, and should be viewed as such, the foul words are common and I turn down the volume. Some scenes involve torture and insane docter people, which can be disturbing for younger children. If your 13 or 14 year old is mature, and won't be frightened, there are almost no sexual themes, or content, and the violence is livable.",0
well the game its self is kinda dark and u are scared every minutes you play when u play it for first time bu then it gets easy to play cause u get use to random things popping at u,0
"This is one of those games that might get hard to play in the dark after an hour or two. It gave me chills when I first started playing it, and there are times when my heart starts beating really fast! This is also quite a difficult game. I don't think most kids younger than a teenager or older preteen would be able to figure this out/have the skill to play it without getting frusterated. The main thing is, its very gory but in a distubing way. You see dead bodies everywhere; on the floor, rotting in coffins, bleeding underneath desks, lying on abandoned operating tables; and you really have to search every dead body you come across in order to have enough supplies such as bullets and money to survive the game. Every inhabitant of the world of Rapture (which is underwater) has gone completely insane because they are addicted to a drug that gives them powers. They run around like wild junkies and attack and attempt to kill you, and you have to either kill or be killed.
There are also little girls called Little Sisters that have parasitic slugs in their stomachs and gather fluid from dead bodies called ADAM, which they drink and collect in order for it to be sold again to the junkies. You have to defeat their body guards and you either get the option of ripping them open and taking the slug to pump the substance into your own veins, or you can save them and get significantly less ADAM so that your character is very weak and its difficult to survive the other crazed inhabitants of Rapture. This game is intense...there are levels in which you travel through operating tables and have to kill a crazy doctor who is dissecting long dead patients. The whole world is very disturbing and incredibly made, the game is excellent, a triumph in gaming really, but....not for most kids. This is really a teenagers only game. Its just too chilling for most kids that are younger.",0
this game is amazing i have beat it before and holy crap it is cool [and hard]why did i put 11+ well its dosent have that much bad words I mean sure there are some here and there but it has a great story and its great plot makes it a great time killer!,1
This game can sometimes be scary but it's ok if your kid is mature,0
"The game is enticing has has a good twist to the story (revealed by Andrew Ryan), and is a lot of fun to play. It is violent and has very dark, sadistic and multiple characters who are sick in the head - ranging from Steinman, obsessive plastic surgeon crazed with the inability to create the perfect “specimen” to Atlas, the mind controller who uses your character to kill the current president of Rapture so he can rule the city. There are sexual references and the usage of enhancing drugs, alcohol and smoking throughout the whole game! With the option to gamble also. There is, although, an ending message of family at the end of the game, so it does serve an educating purpose. Finally, the ethical dilemma of harvesting or rescuing little girls creates an amazing game with hard choices and strong outcomes.",0
"Language: Strong, Infrequent
Sex: Mild References, Infrequent
Violence: Strong, Blood

"Bioshock is a fantastic game with little violence, Perfect for kids age 12 and up! You are given the choice to make moral decisions, and the game rewards you for making the right choice. It's very educational in it's critique of objectivism. Overall a nearly perfect tween-friendly game.",1
"I do think the game delivers positive messages; much like many dystopian works, it is a clear warning - in this case - against an individualist society.
However, it is very adult in theme with very gory violence, psychologically disturbing themes and a complex plot. It’s an amazing game but just be aware of these things.",0
"This game takes place in the 1960’s so make sure your child knows how the 60s were. And though it may look pretty bad. It shows that an objectivist society only benefits those who run it (im a intellectual bear with me) with the hero (a free thinking person) tasked with surviving (and eventually escaping) a underwater objectivist society. True you have the option to kill little girls. But if you know objectivism a common belief is that morality is just a figment of human imagination so you will also want to make sure your child has a good moral compass
I close my statement with saying this isnt a game for those who have no concept of what the world truly is.",0
"Bioshock is an older game, however it is my indisputable favorite video game of all time. It does, however, deal with some very dark themes. The protagonist consumes a lot of alcohol and cigarettes (however it kind of teaches you to avoid alcohol because if you drink too much it becomes hard to see the game for a bit) and there are many mentions of sex. It is definitely an adult game. However the story and the characters are very likable and interesting.",0
"This game is dark in every way, the lighting is dark in most places so it increases fear by the fact the splicers jump out from various areas (splicers are the main villains). The world of rapture (where the game is set) is violent, full of a made up drug and swears, but this game is appropriate for teens depending on what they are exposed to. The fictional drugs are called Adam and Eve (ironic as the main character does not support religion) that give you plasmids (super powers!!)! There are three endings, throughout the game you have the choice the save or rescue little sisters (little girls turned to monsters)if you kill them you get more power, if you save them you get less power but get one step closer to a good ending. The endings consist of good and bad (the third is neutral only it’s the same as the bad ending but with a less angry monologue).",0
AMAZING GAME. Great narrative and some of the best gameplay. Very gory and violent.,0
It’s has a lot of violence and foul language and some inappropriate references in the game. It’s should be ages 16+,0
"This game is for you and you're kids, they'll most likely favorite the ballad of gay tony, seeing how today's world treats gays. There's too much of everything, so let your child explore while, at the same time, warping his mind.",1
"teens should know not to commit crimes in real life. and tweens dont play the missions or go to the strip club, where the explicit content comes from. they just play darts, pool,drive cars, fly helicopters and date. just make sure they dont let younger siblings play it. not for little kids, iffy for tweens, fine for older teens.",0
well if the kid is mature or not my adopted son got it you can i repeat can have sex but i mean your kid probably won't do that its ok for mature kids 10 and up if not 15 and up.,0
"suggestive themes, violence, blood, strong language",0
"I said it, you know it. The GTA games have been made by adults, for adults. And LCS is no different. It contains Violence (which is not the worst part of this game) Extremely bad language, and deeply sexual content. Even though you have most likely heard the conceivable stories, let me put out the concepts from it. A man returns home, there are italians, there is alot of swearing, there is much pervertedness, and there is violence, lots and lots of violence. But in the end you have a game that is deeply addictive, and yes IT IS NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!!!!",0
"Italian mafia = violence, drugs, guns, cars, etc. etc. . Movies with such content is occasionally a thrill; you know. The chasing...the suspence? Well this time we can be IN that thrill. But...just like a movie...it should be treated as nothing more then an escape from reality. Seriously...I'm not going to go out, buy some guns, mug people, and steal some cars...to drive WHEREEVER I feel like with barely ANY COPS CARING. . . . It's just not real. Biggest issue might be urging to swear; buuutt again. It's just as of it were watching a mafia movie.",0
"Ok, so there have been big headlines about the games and a so-called ""Hot Coffee"" modification. The game, as it's released, without modification should be rated Mature. However, due to the existence of run-time altering devices like GameShark, it's possible to alter the game to include parts that may or may not have been part of the original game plan. I've played this game myself, and find the freedom to live a criminal life interesting--but I have the ability to distinguish between fiction and reality. Even if the sexual nature of the game did not exist, you're still shooting cops, committing crimes, and participating in gang-related activity. This game is not for the impressionable.",0
"i love it, its the best my kids play it everyday",1
"I was pleased to see the in the kids reviews, a few of them said they hated the violence, adults like me have no prblem, but it is a great game, it would just be so good without the violence, so kids could play it too, there is a lack of non-linear free roaming kids games",0
"This game should be taken off the shelves of stores!!! i know it says 17 and older that does not prevent some parents from buying this for their children only to let thism play this! this game includeds violence, running people over, shooting people and to get your life replenished you must go out and get a hooker! This is a horrible game and what does it teach our youth??
it teaches them violence and how to disrespect women at a young age.
I understand thos is for grownups but what is to stop an older sibling from letting their smaller sibling from playing it?? It sends a very bad message and only hurts society! Get the GAME off the shelves before it damages our youth anymore!!!
Horrible game and should have never been made!!!",0
"The beautiful thing about the GTA series and what made it so popular is that it gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, go where you want, as many times as you want and in whatever style you want. If you teach you children what is right and wrong there should be no problems in real life. Its a game. Teach them that and it will stay that way.",1
This game is one of those games that people write things about to make it sound like its bad.but the game is a great way to take out anger.If you are like me and you have a strict boss and you come home every day stressed out and angry play GTA beacause you can do what ever you want which takes out stress and anger. I Have three young boys they play it everyday and they are perfectly fine.,1
"My son (2.5) loves this keyboard and the games. He feels so empowered and loves interacting with the characters. We have several of the titles -- Home Hunt, Let's Imagine, First Steps and he enjoys them all. He's bilingual so we enjoy playing the game in both English and French. The USB connector is totally easy for parents and overall, this is a great introduction for kids in language, screen interaction and computer play.",1
"Mario vs Donkey Kong 2: The March of the Minis is a challenging game that kids can enjoy.
The educational value: Kids think their way through challenging levels that will test their logical thinking. You can't go into the challenges blindly.
The role models: Mario is a creative hero who must use his minis to out smart Donkey Kong and rescue Paulene. He makes toys and thinks ahead.
Consumerism triggers: Mario and Donkey Kong appear yet again. Considering how many games the two appeared in, that could cause kids to have the gimmies.",1
Great game for all ages although under age 8 it may be a bit too complex but not for any other reason. Lots of fun!,1
"This is a wonderful logic puzzle I initially bought for myself, but my 9 year old plays it much more than I did.
The goal of the game is to get robotic *toy* mario's to follow a path you create to get them to the next level. It requires thinking ahead logically and having quick reflexes.",1
"My goodness, I don't know why I looked this up again after all these years, I simply adored this game! I used to live in Beltsville, Maryland and while I did the developer came to my town and I was one of the lucky test group that got to play this game raw! From what I remember about it, this game was pretty darn good thought the lesson the game taught took a back seat to my gamer mentality I spent many long hours into the night playing on the game even long after I'd been told to go to bed.",1
who knew that tapping stuff at the right time could be so fun nintendo oh and harmonex or what ever the creators brand who made guitar heros name is any way good game,1
it is the best game you could ever play i never played a game like this in my whole life! :) i dont think there is a problem with it like other people think that it is messed up well its not.,1
"The Nancy Drew games are fun, educational, and totally appropriate. They have interesting challenges, great graphics, and cool plot twists that make them hard to turn off. AWESOME. I highly reccomend any of them.",1
"While yes, you can turn off the strong language and splattering blood, there are a few scenes that some players may find disturbing. Almost instantly after you start playing, you are forced to enter a room with dead humans hanging from hooks with nails through their limbs, the flesh all ripped off, nothing but bones, muscles and organs. Some of the bodies are missing limbs, or are half gone completey! This is inevitable, and you will see this no matter what you do. And even if you turn off the Extreme Content (as the game calls it) it doesnt change the fact that most enemies will be blown apart, limbs flying, especially if you use the chainsaw bayonet. So no matter how you look at it, this game is pretty intense. Turning off Extreme Content will just eliminate F-bombs and excessive blood. There is still a fair bit of language, and TONS of violence.",0
"Hi my name is Ellie, alot of parents just see the mature rating on a game and think it's not right for there child well today I'm here to tell you the truth:
My husband used to work at PEGI (British rating system) and in his time there eventually ended up resenting the system here's why I'll give you a quick insight to the PEGI system: there are a few factors that make a games rating those include: violence, swearing, sex, discrimination, drug use and online features the only problem is that there's no difference in ratings so as an example this game gears of war is violent but nothing worse than a 12+ movie (James bond as an example) then this game also has swearing whereas, overwatch has just a slightly lower level of violence than gears but cut out the Swearing and that games is a 12+ rating the system is broken also they have to make it from a softies perspective so a person who has a lower mental age than there actual age is gonna think this game is to violent and this game doesn't promote drugs or alcohol or sex or any mature themes like that and even if that doesn't persuade you in this entire game you never kill any human beings or innocent creatures only aliens who are trying to kill you so to any parents out there who think the rating says so it must be true have a talk with your kids and understand why they want to play these games also nothing changes in gears 2 or 3 so they are the same to
Best regards,
Ellie",0
"I have both the game and the graphic novel and they're both really badass, the game and the graphic novel have tons of bloody and gory action",0
"I am a die hard gears fan i own all 3 games, all the books and am a proud owner of a pair of COG Tags but this is NOT a game for kids under 17, although I have played online with kids as young as 12, However ALL three games have a mature content option that turns the blood and language OFF turning a M rated game to a T rated game. So all in all this is not a game for kids but parents can turn off all the mature content in the options menu.",0
"People say that this game is super inappropriate. First off, let me say that the violence is all from the aliens, spewing alien blood. Also, the game is extremely fast paced so you don;t even really pay attention to the violence. The language is bad, but nothing any kid over 12 doesn't hear on a daily basis. And to top all this off, there is a filter to turn both these things off. When that happens, the game easily becomes T instead of M",0
"Gears of war is a very gory and violent game, but there is a filter to turn off the blood and gore, and most of the language. My son has this game, and I make him turn on the filter. Make sure you trust your child before letting them play this game.",0
"I play this game with the extreme content filter on because of the language and violence. Even with the filter the language still surprised me with plenty of words like sh*t, b*tch, and some more milder profanities. Some of these words are in the script during story development and some are during the actual gameplay. You hear the phrase ""Eat sh*t and die!"" multiple times throughout the games as NPC's kill enemies. Without the filter it is much worse.
The filter does however take out much of the harsher violence. Without the filter you can literaly blow enemies apart with the shotgun or saw them in half with the cainsaw bayonet. All of the violence is extremely bloody often spraying up onto the screen. WITH the filter there is no blood and enemies do not fall apart. The screen still tints red when you are shot but it is not gruesome. Some of the environments can be a little disturbing with or without the filter. Some areas depict the after math of human encounters with aliens. Bodies are strewn about often in very bad shape (dismembered, bloodied, slightly decayed, etc...) However, none of it is very bad if you don't look closely at it.
The strong point of this game is playing through the story mode with another player. The level of cooperation needed is incredible. My brother and I spend a lot of time playing this game together. It's a fun way to spend time with a good friend or family member.
In the end, this is a great game; great controls, graphics, gameplay and co-op. It is dark and violent but this can mostly be avoided with the filter. It is however, still a game about war so it is best for more mature gamers",0
"Albeit, It is clearly a M rated game, there is a lot of vulgarity among the Cog's (Humans). Online game play is also very vulgar. I'm 25 and would not recommend this game to any one whom cannot go to the counter and buy it",0
"the best game ever. everyone should play this.
i seen 6year old play this so what.",1
"Really fun game! Worth the purchase, and funner then Halo.",1
"This game is definitely NOT for kids under 17. It's brutally violent and constant swearing really makes the whole package an adults only game. Children and tweens shouldn't play this, it wasn't intended for kids. This game is BRUTAL.",0
"Strong language and brutal violence, it's a solid game thats fun for blood and gore lovers and smart people. So why not buy it!",0
"A fabulous and epic RPG thats kid friendly, but also will appeal to teens.",1
"Okay, here is the honest truth about this game, it's amazing. As for content, I laugh at the fact that the game is rated M. Especially since ""Blood and Gore"" are labeled on the game package. The reason for this is that the blood that you see in the game is so mild, it resembles that of a T rated game. There is some mild language and innuendos along the way, but it is pretty hard to find them. The most important part of my review, is to let other parents understand something they most likely did not know: Oblivion was originally rated T, but later was changed to M on account of ""mods"" made by a third party hacker which had nothing to do with the game itself, which added intense blood and gore and nudity to the game. Basically, if you simply buy the game in a store, you will be purchasing a T rated game with an M rated label.",1
"Oblivion is the 4th game in The Elder Scrolls game series and is an incredibly fun game. This game has almost everything you would want from an rpg. Character creation, a huge open world, tons of unique weapons and armor, even spell creation! Even though the game came out in 2006 its graphics are still pretty decent.
Violence 6.5/10 - The violence in this game is incredibly tame for an rpg. You kill humans and monsters with variety of weapons including swords, axes, bows, daggers, and knives. When you hit someone and they don't die there is NO BLOOD! If they do die there will be some blood on the floor underneath them and sometimes there will be blood on your weapon.
Sex 2/10 - Not much to speak of, The occasional innuendo. If you loot the armor of a dead person you can see them in there very unattractive underwear.
Language 3/10 - Again, not much. The occasional damn, hell, or whore.
Additional content: Another thing that will concern some parents is The Dark Brotherhood quest line where the players are payed to kill certain people. This quest line is completely optional, as with all quests in this game. So if trust your son/daughter not to do it than you should be fine.
Overall Oblivion is (in my opinion) one of the best games of all time. A must play for any rpg fan old enough to play it.",0
"Oblivion is an excellent, absorbing, expansive game, that will enthrall any child (or adult) interested in a swords-and-sorcery type world. It won numerous Game-of-the-Year awards in 2006, and was one of the major games that caused people to upgrade their original Xbox to the Xbox 360. Although the graphics have aged a bit, it's still very pretty to look at, and the gameplay is still captivating. It should be noted that it was originally rated T, and I have the PC game box to prove it, as I've been playing it off and on since its original release. Bethesda later caved to parental pressure to change the rating to M based on the release of unauthorized, downloadable, third-party mods FOR THE PC VERSION ONLY, which let you play the game with topless females. The actual game content that you buy in the store (PC or console) is still a T-rated game!!!
There are 5 aspects to Oblivion's rating label that I'll address:
1) Blood and Gore - if your child has seen the Indiana Jones or Lord of the Rings movies, they've seen gorier stuff than this. There will be a bit of blood on your sword after a battle that soon fades away. There are cartoonish-looking corpses and zombies strewn about some dungeons (if you want more realistic ones, look to the game's sequel, Skyrim). Nothing terribly egregious.
2) Language - VERY sparse. Of the thousands of lines of spoken dialogue in the game, ""h**l"" and ""d**n"" might get used a handful of times. Oblivion is NOT Grand Theft Auto. No f-bombs, s-bombs, or G-d's. When there is any mild cursing, it's usually contextually appropriate, related to a pretty intense occurrence in the game.
3) Sexual Themes - this is pretty laughable. You can strip dead bodies down to their drab, unflattering underwear when you loot them for armor, which might elicit a giggle or two the first time your son sees it, but it quickly becomes a non-issue. There are a few sporadic instances of double-entendre (a line of dialogue or two, and a book), but if your pre-teen understands it, then you've got other problems than what's in Oblivion. It will likely sail over their heads.
4) Use of Alcohol - another laughable one. Oblivion is no more corrupting from this standpoint than a stroll through the grocery aisle. Yes, there are alcohol bottles everywhere in the game, but it just blends in with all the other useless detritus you see on shelves and tables (e.g. bowls, spoons, flower pots, etc...). One town specializes in making wine, complete with vineyards outside the town walls, but no one is seen drinking it. All the alcohol is in plain, non-descript, brown (beer, mead, ale) or purple bottles (wine), and you derive no net benefit from drinking it, so what's the point? You can't get drunk and stagger around, and other than a temporary numerical change in your stats, you won't notice any difference in your character. There is one character in the game you might meet who does slur his words and act drunk, well, because he is; but, your quest to reunite him with his long-lost twin brother results in him changing his ways and going sober. What's so bad about that?
5) Violence - okay, yeah, it's violent, but only as much as you make it. I suppose you could wander around picking flowers for hours on end and never raise an angry hand to anything or anyone if you wanted to. Even at its most violent, it's still much less violent than any first-person shooter. And there are consequences for getting out of line and attacking innocent people. My son tried becoming the town bully...once. He soon got his comeuppance from the town guard.
In short, Oblivion is pretty tame as far as mature content goes, compared to other RPG's. It's also much less dark than either its predecessor (Morrowind) or its sequel (Skyrim), and as such, is probably the most approachable of the Elder Scrolls games for kids. The warning label should really just say, ""Obsessive-compulsives approach with extreme caution.""",0
"I would like to say first off that this game was only rated M due to user created mods that made it extremely graphic, violent etc.
The worst this game gets is some ripped up zombie critters that have gaping holes in their flesh, but to be honest it's not as bad as it sounds. The only thing else is sometimes stupid-looking blood that gets on weapons and ground etc, etc.
In terms of anything else, ""hell"" and damn"" were the only language, wine is drinkable and has negative affects, and sex is just silly. Without mods, there isn't any.
This game is easily the best of the elder scrolls, even better than the follow-up, skyrim, and while many may insist skyrim is superior in every way, when really it's only technically ""better"" is in graphics, and even then it's not as pretty.
JUST BUY THIS GAME NOW.YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",0
"The optional ""Dark Brotherhood"" quest line is the darkest part of the game and really adds little overall. Except for DB, players characters can play rather virtuously.
Violence is not especially graphic.
Although alcohol is available, it is not glamorized or prominent. There is very little reason to drink it in the game and it has negative consequences. One can easily complete the entire game without drinking, as far as I recall. Alcohol only enters the game in that players may find bottles of wine or beer and it can be sold along with other found items to merchants for money.
Although most characters can be stripped to underwear, this is only possible on NPC and only after they are ""dead"". It is not provocative or lurid. It occurs as a process of taking the armor or clothing.
Language is overall, quite mild.
""Bad"" behavior has in-game consequences and treating people nicely is often rewarded.",0
I think its a good game. it has its flaws like: you can kill almost everythin and everyone and there is drinking but not very much and they swear very little like they might say h*ll or b*stard or d*mn,0
"Oblivion still holds up well 12 years later, and holds a really important place in my heart. It is a brilliant RPG and is OK for any tween who's into RPGs and hours of exploration. It has a smart main story and hundreds of side quests and is still a very graphically beautiful game. There is mild violence with a tiny bit of blood and characters and animals can be killed. Also, as every elder scrolls fans know there is alcohol/drugs like mead and skooma. This should definitely be a game that your child plays before Skyrim, because the content is much milder.",0
"This game was originally rated T, but some pervert made a mod on the PC and so this game's rating changed to M... The sexual themes are not even bad, some people might even giggle a little bit because you can take people's armor then you can see there under wear. The only language that I saw through out the hole game was d*mn, b*sterd, and h*ll. Blood and Gore: there is some blood on your sword after you fight somebody or something. If you drink alcohol theme there is bad things that happen to you.",0
"Oblivion is a game I own and enjoy, but it may be difficult for parents to decide whether it is kid-friendly. This is because of the sheer scope of the game. You can do almost anything. It is fully possible to charge through the streets, cutting down everyone in sight, although you will be pursued by guards and law enforcement agents if you do. Or you can be a perfectly righteous crusader for justice. The number of possibilities is nearly infinite. Some things that are constant are:
Violence. Usually, the violence in Oblivion is rather mild, no dismemberment or head-chopping, they just fall down, with small amounts of blood. However, there are some fairly disturbing things. When the player encounters zombies, they are VERY disturbing looking. They look like a human than has been fed through a wood-chipper, and then haphazardly put back together. They are stark naked (although partially skeletal, so no real nudity is shown) they do however, show lungs, intestines, and occasionally exposed brains. Similarly mutilated corpses can be found in the lairs of necromancers and other monsters. As for sex, there really is none, except the occasional mild innuendo. You have the choice, after killing a foe, to take all of their armor, leaving them only in underwear. No nudity. Language wise, it's seldom encountered, with the worst word being d***. I would recommend this game for tweens and up, if they can handle some of the more disgusting monsters.",0
"Language-there is a firework called ""Fairies in H--L ""Violence- Death Parks can be used Sex-Some Peeps Kiss (not that bad) Gamble-None no matter WHAT Drugs-Root Beer shop (At least they didn't drop ""Root) Privacy-None (Unlike SimCity)",0
"It requires some coordination. We had to help our 4 year old to aim the remote, but once we did that he had no problems. He really enjoyed it.",1
"This is a must Buy game for kids! It's fun, and Educational! I never thought those two would meet! The Story and explore modes are over quickly, but man, oh man, do they make you use your brain! Yes, there is a bit of Violence, like when a character gets hit with a Bomb, Laser, Hose, ETC. But they don't really get hurt. The one reason why I'm saying it's for kids 9 or Older, is because the puzzles can be kind of difficult. The stage creator ends almost limitless replay value and Posablitys, and a Parent must by this for their child!",1
"If you care about the mental health of you, or a loved one, I'd stay as FAR away from this game as possible. It's infested with pedophiles, cyberbullies, and overall just filled with terrible people. It's toxic, It's tedious, It's addicting, and It's aged HORRIBLY. There was a time where the game was good for kids to learn strategy and teamwork, those days are gone however. The community itself is no exception. You basically get your reputation completely tarnished if you piss off the wrong people in this community. So if you do decide to play the game; play it for the game itself and not the garbage community that drags it down.",0
"At one time (perhaps up to 2008), the game was reasonably good.
I don't recommend the game anymore, and especially not for kids. Most of the subscribers are angry adults or rude teens. There are a lot of bullies, there is a lot of hacking, and there is a lot of elitism in the game. It's not a healthy environment for kids. On top of that, the game is full of ""bugs""/""glitches"" that hamper game play, lag is bad on busy servers (districts), and players get disconnected frequently, often in the middle of a long game or task. It's just not worth it anymore.",0
"This game is perfect for all ages! It is fun, entertaining and very easy to play. In general, there is no excessive violence, innapropriate sexual content or language in the game. Some of the Cogs may scare very young children, but overall, it is supposed to be funny. The only drawback I have about this game is that it can get very addictive. All in all, I would highly recommend this game to everyone!",1
My son hasn't been the same since he started playing this game it is addictive and there are bullies on there. I wish i wouldn't have let him buy the year subscription I am canceling and pray we get our money back.,0
"You can say explicit content and inappropriate and dangerous things when the safety feature is bypassed! Also the difficulty for a 9 year old kid to get from (15 Laff Points - 30 Laff Points) is Insane! There is no way a 9 year old kid would be able to level up easily without frustration and crying because the algorithm on Cog spawning in districts is so terrible! I am a 24 year old Adult and even I had to put some considerable effort in, Heck I used to play this game everyday as a kid and it's Not Like The Original! STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE HAVING A BAD AND UNFAIR TIME!",0
"I'll be very honest...looking back at this game over half a year of not playing it, I think Toontown in general is a terrible game. Many elements of it rub me the wrong way to where it gets me really angry. To get the good elements out of the way, the game is creative with its setup and can have some original designs with the robots(yea, yea I know they're ""cogs"") and soundtrack. That's it. Where do I began with the terribles things about this game? Let me just say that people only scratch the surface about this game, because one of the biggest issues I have with it is the main point of the game: to fight the robots. Here's the thing, when you're a kid, you are not supposed to be concerned about the business world, but the game makes it appear like you have to be because you have to fight back at it. It portrays adults like they are nothing but unemotional workaholics who only want you to grow up to be like them. Well, hey, the reality is that when you grow up, you HAVE to get into the work field yourself. OK, is the game trying to convey the message of just be a kid? You can, you can be a kid, because you're not old enough to work. Not only is this whole setup, which yes I did like the creativity about it but not itself, confused, but it is completely appalling as it can give the kids the mindset that adults are the enemy. Most parents do not try manipulate their kids at such a young age, they only want them to be themselves and have fun before they grow up and realize they have to be like the robots in this game. It's almost like the game shines kids away from the reality of growing up and adapting, trying to convey the idea that you have to stay a kid while also dismissing the workfield, something they shouldn't even be introduced to yet. I almost feel like someone in production of the game wanted revenge on an adult from their childhood that tried to manipulate them and make them completely aware of the work field and how it'll affect their lives. And, I'm sorry, this is a serious flaw of the game. Do we really want to have a world where children go into an office building and throw squirt guns and pies everywhere? That's a good way to get grounded(or worse). Should kids be the ones to murder hardworking people in a factory? If the game even does have some kind of moral to it, it's completely lost, confused, and possibly even offensive to hardworking people with kids. That's one thing, something I also have to criticize is the animation of the game. Some things look okay like some of the designs of the robots are kind of unique. Yet, a lot of them are just reused for another. The Telemarketer and the Spin Doctor have the exact same head and body, and so does the Short Change and Cold Caller! The Bloodsucker and Mover &amp; Shaker have the same outline, the Yesman, Glad Hander, and Hollywood all have the same face. The Name Dropper and Number Cruncher also have the same head shape. Even The Mingler and Two-Face have the same head shape. Couldn't this game have been more creative with that? The animal toon designs range from cheap to irritating to look at. The pig looks okay, but animals like the monkey and ESPECIALLY the cat are just so generic and uncomfortable to look at. The animation itself could've been better, especially from Disney in 2003. It doesn't hold up to this day, it looks better in 1996 or something. The community has always, been, AWFUL. The people are either toxic, impudent, or both, all thanks to when they opened chat. I could argue it has changed people's minds in a bad way. People on this game can be huge jerks to each other for no reason. A lot of people(ranging in age) have this very odd way of talking to each other through these stupid text emojis. The awkward but also awkward face: o_o The ""you're weird"" face: o_O and o.O The anime-laugh face: xD The awkwardly surprised face: o.o and the constant, constant dork face: :P Along with the way everyone communicates on the game including ""long, sound"" for fighting a factory. These people have literally developed their own language, a degenerating one. Using words like ""noob"" and abbreviations like ""bldg"". People don't even take the game seriously anymore, they treat it more like they're ordering something on the phone: ""I'd like a 'short soundless', please."" ""Yes, can I have a 'boarding group', please?"" ""I'd like to order a ""D"", please."" That last one refers to the Offices in Lawbot HQ. If you all talk like this, why do you still even play it? It baffles me to think that people are this desperate to keep the game alive. I mean honestly, Toontown ""Rewritten""? What's even rewritten about it, it's practically the same exact game? Along with this one server called Toontown ""Offline"", that's where you can be nothing but bullies and use such offensive language. Yea, that'll be great for kids... Can't you have just let this game rest in peace? So, yea, horrible game to be. Used to like it as a kid, but now flipped sides entirely now as an adult",0
"Very good game when you are really young and personally, I think this is the first MMORPG kids should play. Also, there is a remake of this game.",1
"My son became way too entranced with this game and became way too involved with his ""friends"" (unknown players). It was addictive and impossible to play at short intervals. It caused major behavioral issues in an otherwise amiable and cooperative little boy. We tried this game at different intervals, and he had his membership revoked both times. There is no old enough to handle it, it definitely did sometthing to my son, he is not himself when allowed to play this game.",0
well me and my son use to play together alot until i had my toon high and i couldnt remember the email address so i cant play that toon anymore then he decided to play again his account has been hacked and they decided to terminated his account for things he didnt say theres way too much hacking in the game and toontown dont care they wont even do anything about it my account even got terminated one time for something my son did and i was half way maxed i wasnt able to get my account back at all there is also too much nasty sexual behavior on there too many bots being made all they care about is the money they dont even try to get hackers out of there so we can enjoy our playing it use to be good,0
"Toontown can certainly be addictive. I should know, as an adult who plays way too much. I think it is important for parents to realize there are many adults who play. Most of the adult players I have met started playing with their children, and then discovered, as I did, that the game contains sufficient depth and strategy to be interesting for players of all ages. Fortunately, the adult players I have met appear to have the best interests of the children at heart, and work to keep this a child friendly game. With that said, there is always the potential for a child to be approached by an adult with criminal intent. For this reason, it might be a good idea to not permit your child to have open chat (they can be limited to the speed chat). However, open chat is almost necessary when/if they reach the higher levels of the game, as many players will not invite chatless toons into battle groups. I eventually ""caved"" and gave my daughter chat, with clear instructions (I hope) on safe chat vs. unsafe.
Other comments -- she learned a lot of math early on (number of points to defeat a cog), and her typing skills improved once she got chat.
I was initially taken aback by the cartoon violence, and somewhat concerned about its psychological effects. But ... the enemy is always a robot. Does it really harm a child to see a piano dropped on a robot? You have to decide that for yourself. I rated this for 7+ because of the violence and chat issues, but my daughter started much younger.
I like the cooperative aspect of the game. Occasionally there are toons or groups (bored teens?) that will attempt to sabotage other players, but almost all toons, kids and adults, are in the game to have fun and work together.
All in all, it's a fun game, but you may want to watch that it doesn't take over your child's (or your own, lol) life!",0
"This is a great game for a mature child that can handle a little bit of violence and language. This game makes you think before you do, for example: If you are on a mission to retrieve a piece of equipment and there are three entry points, you need to think which entry point would be the most effective point to approach. You have to work with others/your teammates to complete the mission successfully. If you don't make the right choices you could end up failing the mission. Unlike some other popular shooter games, like gta or payday, you are not the antagonist. You might be fighting to save a group of civilians, not rob a bank or get away with murder. Over all this game is acceptable for any mature teens over the age of 12 or 13.",0
"Fun for all warfare video game lovers. Storyline is fun, and the terrorist hunt never gets old. This game is also a lot funner when you play it with friends. The more terrorist killers the better.",0
You definately don't want younger children watching this one. The language is bad; and they will always pick up those you don't want them too. The violence is like most war games and is pretty intense.,0
I really loved the gameplay and the graphics in this game,1
Freakin sweet game. I play it on my 360 with Gears of war and Crackdown,1
"This is an awesome game. Depending on your connection it could get a little glitchy. However, the game is solid as a rock. The computer A.I. is excellent. The achievements are not easy to obtain, but well earned if you learn to adapt to the game. Also, it is very important to make alot of friends to gain the achievement of Master of Ceremonies. You will know what I mean when you play the game. I highly recommend the purchase of this game.",1
This game causes you to think before you act. You must be sure that the way you're executing your plan will not result in your death or the death of you squad mates.,0
"I think it is a little misleading to lump the xBox 360 version in with the PSP version. The PSP is rated T, and having played both, I think it is related to the fact that PSP has no foul language. Both games are very good, and I think should be playable by kids 10 and above. My son is 9 and we have a good time playing the xBox version with the sound down to not hear the cursing. Otherwise, loosen up a little bit people.",1
"This game is amazing for kids of ANY age, from old enough to hold a PSP to almost too old to hold a PSP. Now if I could only get my wife to give up the game to my grandchildren . . .",1
"This is a cute, somewhat fun game. However, it's biggest fault is that it has no tutorial, so I had a lot of trouble figuring out the controls. Also, it contains characters blowing up into little pieces, and it is quite difficult to understand what you are supposed to do.",1
Brilliant lego game! Great for kids! I recommend to parents that they buy this game for their kids!,1
"My boys love Star Wars and Legos, and my husband loves video games, so this game is a natural fit for our family. I don't want my kids playing violent video games, but since it's just blasting legos apart, I let them play this game, although it's the only shooting video game I will allow them to play.
I really enjoy the creativity of converting the Star Wars story into a video game with Legos. The mini-figures do some funny things! You can play with 1 or 2 players, and the 2nd player can easily drop in or out of the game at any point which makes it nice for the parents or friends to play along. We usually play along since our boys are young and still learning how to play and they often need our help still to finish a board. I enjoy playing it as much (if not more) than they do, so it's a fun activity for everyone.",1
I bought this game for twenty dollars at Target and I play it with him. (He is 6 and loves legos and built some of the lego Star Wars sets.) We love this game and have fun solving the puzzles together. The graphics and the humor are extremely enjoyable.,1
"The idea of shooting ""people"" even tho they are lego's with guns, probably not for the young. I would think this is more for older children and adults, i sure liked playing it!",0
This game and the one before have been an excellent way for my 8 year old to play a fun game together! We have spent hours working through this game enjoying the time together and the challenges!,1
"I am the mother of 2 ten year old boys and they love to play this game! My husband and I also enjoy this game. We are all lovers of Legos and the original Star Wars trilogy.
This games has held my kids interest. It is one that they want to go back to again and again. And so do I!
The game is appropriate for a child who is 8+ and who can understand the cartoon violence in the game. There is ALOT of shooting and lightsaber swinging. I let my kids play this game, because it is sci-fi made into a funny cartoon. Plus there is no gore or horror.",1
"Fisrt off, my kids 10,7 and 5 LOVE this game. Even my teenage nephews seem to like it quite a bit - so it definitely has some longevity and they play it quite a bit. If your kids are familiar with star wars movies it helps but it not necessary. Slightly violent but characters are all lego guys so they just break apart.
My biggest problem with the game is the multiplayer function. While very well implemented, it seems my kids are always bickering while playing this game (much more so than others) becuase it requires teamwork to move forward and complete tasks/missions. If one player is lagging behind (all players on the same screen in a cooperative mission) and the other one is more capable they seem to get frustrated with each other easily because in effect, the less talented player is ""holding back"" the better player. Hence, the constant coaching and commanding from better player to lesser player to ""come on"" ""get moving"" and - yes unfortunately ""kill that guy"" comments to which I am constantly saying ""don't say kill...say get that guy.."" to no avail. Otherwise, great game which they always play and love but may cause some bikereing and frustration between freinds and siblings unless they are equal in ability (or at lest very understanding).",1
"My son (9) loves this game. which was a gift. However, my husband and I have some issues with it. It is definitely a shooting game -- throughout, the player must kill characters and destroy enemy vehicles in order to complete the levels. You collect ""studs"" in order to buy stuff to help you -- our complaint is that you gain studs by shooting up everything in sight -- chairs, trash cans, lights, your own allies. Even if it's cartoon violence, it's still pointless violence. We prefer games like Major League Baseball and Flight Simulator.",0
"It's great to find a game that not only holds the attention of everyone in our house (no small feat in my case, or so says my wife) but also encourages teamwork and cooperative play between the players. Another reviewer mentioned bickering and I have to say that I agree, though I think my wife and I are worse than our son. This game served as his introduction to the Star Wars Universe and he's absolutely loving it. We are still a bit concerned about the violence but it's always presented in a humorous manner and my son can see far worse by turning on the tv. I should mention the best part of the game is that players can drop in or out at will... this is great when you're playing with the kids and have to get up and do something (answer the door, check on the dogs, etc). My favorite part of the game is watching my son run around the house trying to use the force on all of us. An absolute blast and amazing game that will keep kids of all ages entertained!",1
"I love this game. It was one of the first games I got when I got the Wii for Xmas. There's a lot of blood, but that's because you're dealing with the human body. And there's medical terrorism-ish stuff too. There is some flirting, and at one point, a person says something sexual that I will NOT repeat. The language is mostly from one person too. It's a pretty good game overall.",0
"if this game had differnet songs i would give it a 10! its fun and challenging but several songs are by ""death metal and ""metalcore"" groups whose songs contain very disturbing lyrics re: suicide and phrases such as ""destroy yourself, see who gives a ****"" even f profanity is edited for game its the contect in these songs that is very disturbing! not ok for ant teen. its beyond me why these songs were included-these are not mainstream groups and with over 40 years of rock history you would think they would have plenty to choose from without introducing teens to these types of bands and dark material.",0
"Found alot out about the Guitar hero games they use a symbol on their games that is used by devil worshippers. it's kinda like ""I love you"" but with the thumb tucked in. it means ""Forked One"". you can see it on hte home page of the web site! Please do your homework parents! Be careful with these games!!!!",0
"Great game. very addictive and fun. This game may encourage your kid to get into 70's rock or start playing the guitar. They cut all of the songs that would be bad such as ""Killing in the Name"" by Rage Against the Machine. All of the female charatures are scantly clothed. Don't worry about anything being bad about this game except for its addictivness.",1
"My sons are now in their 20s and I've never played one of their games until Guitar Hero II. I wasn't great but I had a lot of fun. I pleased them because at last we had something we could share. Of course, some songs by Glen Campbell would have been a real treat!",1
This game is very fun and is grEAT! I dont see why there are any problems with it because you cant even here the singer over the guitar!,1
"This game is wonderful. The graphics are great for a oldies, despite that it is a remake, and is loaded with historical facts. Great for those who want to let their kids have fun AND learn at the same time. Happy Pirating!",1
Great game. Teaches you to read. I recommend for a four year old's tool.,1
The system was a little difficult to set up but once we got it going my daughter loved it. She is only five and she is reading along with it already. It os wonderful!,1
"This is an amazing game, one of the best of all time, and it would be appropriate for younger kids if the storyline wasn't so dark. GLaDOS is a robot who will twist and manipulate you and later on the game, try to kill you with things such as turrets, falling cubes, poison water, and an attempt to incinerate you. Don't get me wrong, the storyline isn't so dark and twisted that it deserves an M, I think it is fit for a T, maybe even an E10+. Plus, it might be appropriate for younger kids, if they don't listen to the storyline on games really. But, it's not recommended for young kids. While GLaDOS is very manipulative, she is also likeable and very funny. The game is humorous, in a dark sort of way. GLaDOS is also creepy, because of everything she says, and what she has done (you will learn this at the end of the game, if you haven't already figured it out by the clues they gave you before you got there.) Overall, this is an amazing game, and even though it is short, I wasn't expecting a big 10-20 hour game on a disc with 5 games on it.
10/10",0
No concerns for anyone over 10. Anyone younger may find the game creepy and/or too difficult to play (some levels are so hard they make your head hurt),0
"It's very rare for my three kids (13-year-old boy, 11-year-old girl, and 8-year-old girl) find a game that all three of them like, and even rarer for me to want to play along with them, but this game was a blast for all of us to play through as a family. It's a first-person shooter without any actual shooting and with very minimal graphic violence (pretty much limited to some blood spatter on the wall behind you if you're hit by turret fire.) The physics-based puzzles are smart and require thought, strategy, and creativity to solve... I've rated this 10 and up not because my 8-year-old was upset or frightened, but simply because she could not have gotten through some of the later test chambers without help. I had to ask my far more game-savvy son for help a few times when I got stuck! The writing and voice work is top-notch (featuring Ellen McLain as... pretty much the only voice in the game, including the adorable end credit song.) More sensitive kids may be upset by the dark humor, which is vaguely unsettling at first and progresses to flat-out passive-aggressive hostility towards the end, but this wasn't an issue for my kids at all. Even my 8-year-old thought GLaDOS was hilarious, and she is much-quoted around our house at this point. Finally, my 11-year-old daughter was enthralled that this is essentially an all-female game. The player character, Chell, is female when you are able to glimpse her through well-placed portals, and GLaDOS, the main antagonist, is female (or at least female-voiced) as well. Even at 11 my daughter is frustrated at how there are few females in games that are not portrayed as eye candy or as the victim that the male player-character needs to rescue... having the opportunity to play a game that comes down to a battle of wits between two tough, resourceful female characters was very gratifying for her.",1
"GLaDOS, the robotic antagonist of the game, is THE best video-game antagonist! Her hilariously snarky dialogue makes playing through the puzzles in this game so motivating and fun! Who doesn't love a video-game villain that makes you laugh so hard? The general franchise is fantastic with lovable characters and aspects as well as memorable dialogue that sparked famous memes in the community.
The only content in the game that I wouldn't say is for young kids is the slight bits of blood that can be seen on the floors and walls after the player gets shot by turrets. However, there's even less blood in the 2nd game. That's as far as violence gets. You only destroy enemies by dropping them through portals or incinerators which isn't graphic at all. Language and other visual content in the game is clean.",1
"This is one of the best puzzle games ever. GlaDoS is hilarious and it certainly gets your mind going. Just what some children need :)
At some points yes, there is shooting. But that's not the main aim of the game. You use a portal gun to complete each chamber, whilst having a funny robot say random things to you. Or are they random?
Honestly good fun and perfect for kids to try and get their heads around.",1
"This is an excellent puzzle game with good problem solving and a good ""plot"". GlaDos is a load of fun. There are areas with a notable amount of blood, which is why I think it should be rated Mature (those blasted turrets). It's not everywhere, just be warned because it comes after you get very comfortable.",0
Brain teasing puzzles absolute great game,1
"All the people in the game are female, or female voiced, so it isn't mean to girls. There is minimal blood, when you get hit by a turret fire, but other than that it is a good game.",1
It has violence and is very dark. but this game has puzzles and requires your mind,0
"turrets are robots that shoot you if you recover by hiding, and then come out again repeatedly, you get blood splatters on the wall like leonardo da vinci painted it himself when he was angry.",0
"Portal is an excellent puzzle game that I want my future kids to play. It really stretches your mind and has some amazing (albeit a tad bit dark) humor, which is why I recommend it for teenagers, who are reaching a point in their lives when they can understand when something is a little messed up and not take it as a norm.
That being said, compared to the vast stretch of games out there, it is quite low on violence (you knock over robots and blow up the the evil Artificial Intelligence at the end by solving a puzzle). The ""gun"" itself only shoots portals that you walk through, and it represents the only ""weapon"" in the game.
Minor violence and some mildly dark humor are the only issues that someone could possibly find wrong with this game, which are far outweighed by the benefits of a well-made puzzle. As far as its short length is concerned, go buy Portal 2, which is much longer and has a mode where they can play alongside, and work with, a friend.
I was really surprised that this website doesn't recommend the game ""Antichamber"", which can be purchased on the computer from the website store.steampowered.com
Antichamber is an incredible puzzle game that has stumped me pretty hard, and I'm a mathematician. It's a simple, yet wonderfully logical game for older teens who want a challenge. The only reason that I suggest it to that age group is simply because how difficult it is to complete it, but anyone would have fun wandering through this mind-bending fun house. Essentially, take the first-person shooter puzzle nature of Portal, and insert it into a game that is constructed to look and behave like an M.C. Escher painting using Alice in Wonderland logic, and you have Antichamber. It challenges you to look past the assumptions that we make based on spatial reasoning and figure out the logic of the room, rather than where an exit or goal should appear.
One of the very first puzzles involves walking around a corner into a room to find two stair cases, one going up and the other going down. Upon choosing a stair case to traverse, you go up or down, turn a corner, and run into a another set of identical staircases. After choosing between several identical staircases in this manner, you realize that you are being sent back to the beginning of the same room each time, and that you must choose the one path that you haven't selected, which is to go back the way you came, and when you turn around to go back around the corner you find that room you came from has changed into a tight corner that makes you run around in circles of changing corner (almost as though the corner was a post in the middle of a room that changes as you walk around it), and then it spits you out onto an exit that takes you out of the puzzle and back to the beginning of the maze, which is what the game is... It's amazing.
If you have a teen who eats through puzzle games like they're nothing, you should get them Antichamber. There's no violence, no dialogue (so no language), no sexual stuff, no money,... nothing bad to speak of, except that it's a devilishly inspiring and mind-blowing puzzle.
Sorry to seem like I'm advertising, but I tried to find if you guys had even heard of this gem, but there's no review for it on your website, which is a shame.",1
"I would like to start out with the fact that humanity is still alive and well in the game and it's squeal. They are just outside Aperture. The same cannot be said for the scientists,who, through story telling, are found to be wiped out by nuerotoxin, although this is not shown in the game. I have played both games and found them great. I am an avid gamer and can closely relate to many people's situations. That being said, this is a great title. I would especially recommend Portal 2 for father-son time as well.",1
"Portal 1/2 is a great game, however it has some statements that could be offensive if not understood properly, so make sher your kid has a understanding that the statements are not meant to offend anyone rather then just make the bad guys look more bad.",1
"Portal is my absolute favorite game. It is the only game I consider to be perfect. I've thought long and hard about what on earth could be wrong with this game, but my mind always seems to draw a blank.
Part of this I feel is that the premise of portal's mechanics are fairly simple: get from point A to point B without dying...oh, and you also have a gun with the ability to shoot interdimensional portals which can instantly teleport you between any two places you can shoot at.
GLaDOS is possibly my favorite video game character of all time. Her dialog is dark and mean, but funny and smart.
I think though that it should be 13 and up. Less because of the violence (only a bit of blood from turrets) and more because I feel the ability to fully comprehend the situation in the game is important. The need fully understand the dialog and the logical reasoning required to figure out why things are the way they are are both salient points required to get the most out of Portal.
And remember, the weighted companion cube will never threaten to stab you and in fact, cannot speak. :)",0
"Played this with my 8-year-old daughter after we fell in love with Quantum Conundrum and went exploring to try to find other games created by the same team. Portal was actually created first and was surprisingly suitable for both of us. The puzzles are quite challenging -- she enjoyed playing them with me but would've gotten stuck on her own.
I clicked the ""violence"" button only because of the presence of guns, bullets and blood. As scary as that might sound, the guns and bullets are entirely confined to the ""turrets,"" which are inanimate objects that shoot at you when you're in range. If they hit you, a blood spatter will be left behind you on the floor or other surface. This was incredibly mild and frankly it's hard to describe how charming the turrets really are. You do have to disable them, hence the ""violence against inanimate objects"" component in the complete review on this site.
GlaDOS is a riot. The darker elements of her humor will be lost on younger kids. To me this is a little like a Pixar film -- there's hilarious content that the kids won't get. I'm sure Portal wasn't created with kids as the target audience, but to me there are no concerns here. I rated it as appropriate for 7 and up because we would've played this when my daughter was younger had we known about it.
All in all, I'd say this is truly one of the better computer games I've personally ever played. It's educational in that it forces you to think about physics and it presents some mind-bending challenges. With great music, a well-thought-out and entertaining script, what is arguably the greatest voice-over work ever (thank you to Ellen McLain for that), and a really engaging story, this game is a winner!
Oh and... um, there's cake!",1
"I got my first DS Lite for Christmas when I was 7 and Nintendogs is one of the games i got with it. I would never have chosen this game. I don’t like dogs and from what I could tell, this game looked boring. But since I didn’t really have any other DS games at the time I ended up playing this game and I was very surprised that I actually enjoyed it. In fact, I still occasionally play this game nowadays, more than 10 years since I first got it!
There’s not much to this game, you just take care of virtual dogs: feed them, walk them, train them, play with them, groom them, bathe them etc. and somehow it’s not as boring as it sounds. My favorite part of the game is the competitions. I’m a champion at the disc competition! Unfortunately you can’t enter competitions whenever you want and are limited to only 3 competitions a day. I’m very impressed with how well the DS mic works with this game, for example, you can call your dogs names/commands out loud into your DS and your dogs will hear you and obey (if you’ve trained them to obey, of course!) there’s also a bubble toy and in order to blow bubbles with it you have to literally blow into the DS mic and it works pretty realistically. I don’t know of many other DS Lite games that require use of the mic, especially this much, but I’m really impressed with how well it actually works, especially considering the fact that the first DS model came out in 2004. (The DS Lite came out in 2006, but Nintendogs came out in 2005 so it can work with both versions.)
Overall this game isn’t one of the best DS games, but it’s not one of the worst either. If you like dogs then playing this game is a no brainer for you. But even if you’re like me and you don’t like dogs, you still might find something charming about it. This game could also be used to teach kids the responsibilities of caring for a pet. 5+",1
"Very nice to play with a friend, or to releve stress!",1
"I bought the Chihuahua version for my 7 year-old on her birthday and she had no trouble figuring it out. There are a whole bunch of these games now with all different breeds, definitely more than just three as the initial review says. A little help reading the text and helping her get started, especially with training, but I only needed to show her once. It's a very cute game, she was laughing hysterically at times when puppy was playing. That's always a good sign. She hasn't had it for long, so I can't speak to the longevity of the gameplay yet.",1
I LOVE IT!!! This game is great for dog lovers :).,1
"Love this game. Can't say I've never ""borrowed"" my 8 year olds Nintendo DS and played it myself. It's super fun. It actually prepares you for taking care of a puppy. Great game. There are no safety problems, it's fun, yet safe. Kids can't complain, they love it. Parents can't complain because they love watching their children be safe, and play it. It's incredible. Also makes a great gift, I've bought it both for my 5 year old, for her 5th birthday, but also my 7 year old niece for Christmas.",1
this game is really fun and educational because it teaches little kids all the basice of taking care of a puppy. boys probably wont like but all girls 6 and up will!,1
Living in a house with 2 cats and a large dog I have to say this is the best pet of the bunch. No actual poo to scoop or food bags laying around. My kids love this game.,1
"This is the best dog sim I have seen, period. The graphics are great and it's fun to collect items for your puppies.
The only problems I have with the game are:
1) The voice-recognition feature is pretty poor. Sometimes the dogs won't understand your commands.
2) The puppies never grow up. Older dogs are fun too, but we never get to see them. It would be much more fun to watch the puppies turn into mature dogs after a while.",1
"I picked this game up and thought ""this can't be anything like caring for a real dog."" I was right, but it's better than a real dog since all messes made are virtual! This is a really adorable game and had me falling in love with the little puppy on the screen. Very innovative and well done.",1
"My daughter loves this game. She's adopted 4 puppies and cares for them and plays with them. You can train them to do tricks and earn points. You can take them on a walk where you get to choose the route and sometimes the puppy finds presents and brings them to you. When you earn points you can buy things for your dogs, upgrade your house and buy more puppies. I've even picked up this game several times and played it. I really enjoy it myself and I'm not much of a gamer.",1
Nintendogs is my 9 year old grandaughter's favorite game. She thinks it really helps people to learn how to take good care of their puppies and dogs. She is also learning about the responsibilty and expense involved with having an animal. She plays it alot.,1
M: violence and destruction,0
"Good game, best hulk expierence!",1
"Wow, high graphics. Now this comes from a site who praises the Playstation and said Halo 2 had so-so graphics. How about you stop favorism and reviewing 90% PS2 games and giving them too much credit. Example, God of War having an educational value? Now back to the game, the Hulk has comic books galore to collect. Now I would think that would be sarcasm/just a tad/sarcasm more commercialism than educational.",1
"Entertaining game without blood gore or violence. the king is nonsensical and selfish but the non-threatening atmosphere and exposure to the ""pop"" Japanese music is entertaining and catchy. My 5 yr old is a little too young yet to navigate the controls but she manages a few of the easier boards. Overall an off-beat but very fun game",1
"I've got to say, I am completely impressed with this game! My son is 6 and he loves to play it and it really re-inforces what he's learning in school. He already knew his alphabet, but the writing practice is really helping him. My daughter is 3 and she's already starting to write her letters thanks to this game. The only frustration for her is that you have to press the button on the side of the l-max pen at the same time that you are trying to play the game. That's a little much for a three-year-old's hands. So she needs lots of help to play. I think this game is a little frustrating for 3 year olds and would advise most people to hold off until their kids are 4-6. It depends on if they have expressed any interest in writing on their own yet. If you've had experience with other tracing games on leapster cartridges (Disney Princesses or Mr. Pencil) this one is much, MUCH more forgiving and less frustrating than those. So it's a vast improvement over those games. Plus, being able to see what you've written on the TV screen is very fun!
This is an awesome game and both of my kids are loving it!",1
4 yr old loved it. Got it for xmas and has already mastered it. 2 yr old trying to play it now. Highly recommend.,1
"Beautiful and serene to ride through, then harrowing platform-like puzzles which are perfectly scaled. Most of the game is PG, scaling and stabbing ancient moving creatures which spray black shadows, save one intense moment in the final cutscene. An 8 or nine year old can complete it, and any kid can safely watch.",1
I think that this game is totally amazing. The game revolves around killing the Colossi but thatis only part of the experience. When playing this game a player cannot help but become emotionally involved in the quest that wander undertakes. As he moves across this large world in silence as he completes amazing feats in the hope of somehow saving his princess.,1
"Shadow of the Colossus is one of the most brilliant games to date. Graphics, sound and gameplay are outstanding, and those that say there was no storyline unfortunately didn't get it. It's varied messages are powerful, as it transcends typical good and evil, or saving the princess plot.
What we see is the hero, alone with his horse and a body of a woman. He comes to a land where no humans live, but are guarded by large creatures, some the size of 12 story buildings. The woman is somehow cursed, and he is here to resurrect her. For the first and second parts of the game, we are told very little, focusing on the protagonist and his enemy. But is his enemy evil, or is the character that we play there for his own greed, killing these wonders? Is he here for something much bigger than him? We don't know until the very end, and when it comes, it's much more surprising than anything you could have ever imagined. There will be a divergence of thought as to the how and why.
And don't get me started on that horse. Agro is Wander's (our hero) horse, and he is simply amazing. He is big, he is fast, and is the single most agreeable, naturally acting animal I have ever seen in a video game. And I don't even like horses. There is something near the end that Agro does with Wander that will stay with you forever. It's an awe inspiring scene, though a bit sad.
I'm not going to ruin anything for you. If you consider yourself a gamer, or even a passing one, and you want to see how far a game can go without a machine gun, space marines, and thousands of characters ad nauseum this is the perfect game. IT does require a bit of thought on your part. The story is not handed to you in a neat little package Hollywood style. Ico was the game that came out before this, and it was told with a minimalist style, much like this one. There are echos of the bible, such as a forbidden land, the possible voice of (a) god, life after death, &amp; prayer. You are welcome to interpret several ideas and story events, but you will be handsomely rewarded if you pay attention to small details.
SOTC received over 17 awards, including Best Character Design, Best Game Design, Best Visual Arts and Game of the Year. The music also received awards and recognition, and remember Agro? He got ""the best sidekick in the history of video games"". I wasn't kidding you about him.
I don't know how many times I should say it. This game changed the way I view games as a whole. Consequences to my actions, forcing me to make me think about what I'm doing, making me feel more in touch with the character(s) I see on the screen, &amp; giving me unique perspectives on situations that go well beyond a typical story line is not what I expected, but that's what I got. If you play this with your child, (as I did) expect some pretty incredible discussions, if you let it.",1
"I just had to own this game, the beautiful artwork and graphics took me in awe. I just love the mysteries and puzzles the game provided. The huge 16 beasts are truely amazing and find them haunting my dreams. This game has made a big impact on my imagination and can't wait to see more games like this. If not, I will create my own along the same lines but different storyline of course.",1
"This game can be summed up with one word: fantastic! No other game for the PS2 comes close. The graphics are about as good as it gets on the PS2 and the story is very intriguing. The fights are excellent. Even if you only have 16 of them, it's great. The soundtrack is also very well done. I would recommend this game to anyone anywhere who enjoys a good video game.",1
"This game is probobly the best game ever created, while there are only 16 fights, the puzzle-solving to take them down gradually gets much harder.",1
"This game is a must have!!!!! It is addicting you start to think to your self ""One more colossi then I'll quit. Although it is addicting it is very challenging, so if your kids have a short attention span, I would'nt advise this game.",1
The game has many different amazing aspects. Such as the loneliness and friendship you share with your horse.,1
"The Tom Clany title makes parents wonder. Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, both rated M. This T rated title could have been a lot worse. Instead they took the tame way out. Ghost Recon AW2 is a strategy game with the occasional third person shootout. It is a third person, not third person view making it less violent to start, second, language isn't strong, only the occasional ""Get the Hell out of there soldier!"" And there is no blood whatsoever except when you go into a mini game sniper mission which is completely optional, and not bad. You are fighting for the greater good of America against terrorism. A lot is spent in night vision anyways. Terrorists are emotionless and the game is fun and strategic. 11+ at the oldest",1
"Blood and Violence when you shoot people, Swearing and use of legal drugs.",0
this game is okay for people in their tween years but what most parents are scared of is violince. the new ghost recon future soldier is way better i have the beta and it wasn't that violinet or bloody i just want to say this game is as good as any.,0
"there is nothing content wise, wrong with this game. fantastic blend of strategy and action make this a must have for ghost recon fans, RTS fans, and third person shooter fans.
if you want gears but it's too over the top for you, this is the game to buy.
also, when you can find online matches they are fun too.",1
I'm a huge military game buff... and if you enjoy tactical shooters in 3rd person then this is definatly a game for you. I would say that kids above the age of 10 can handle the game... though they may find the tactical basis of the game a little complicated to grasp. All in all an excellent game with a good story line... I would also recommend the original GRAW.,1
"The game editors made some improvements in being able to save your progress. The plot depth is adequate, reminds me of Blackhawk down, but graphics are more realistic.",1
"Um... this is good for kids. Though I am a Mario fan and decided to buy anyways. If you have played the REAL DDR and you can hold out on Standard mode, this game is NOT for you. It is for entry-level players.
However, I could only do Standard on real DDR and I have actualy gotten better playing HARD, VERY HARD, and I am approaching the SUPER HARD level. Songs like Bowser's Castle are REALLY hard. But the hardest songs are only 9 footers.
There are lots of elements that they left out in the game, Freeze and the carietys of modes are forgotten.
In short, this game is good if you are desperate and can't afford a PS2. If not, but the real thing and see where the REALY challenge is!",1
"This is a fun-filled game for sharp-minded children/teens and even adults! Music is for everyone and should be shared and enjoyed in many different ways. I believe that this game inspired me to continue with music and pursue it as a career! Guitar Hero gives personality to non-musicians and can even be a kick-start to starting younger kids off with learning an instrument. Games that are also like this would be rock band, which features different instruments such as Bass Guitar, Drums, and Vocals. This is a more interactive game and can be fun for more than just a two-person, PS2 game. I grew up with a PS2 and when I got this game for the first time, I played every single song on the game until I beat it! It was addicting and I loved the concept of the game and the songs are a mixture of a lot of different artists and genres. There's a song for everyone to enjoy on it!",1
"Incredible fun. As stated in the Common Sense Media review the game requires a special guitar controller that is packaged with the game, and it really makes the experience just that much better.
On the content, it is really just making fun of the stereotypical rock n' roll imagery. After one of the tutorials groupies and a ""video"" are mentioned. Some songs such as David Bowie's classic ""Ziggy Stardust"" contain mild language... but does it matter? No. A buy if you're willing to drop the dough.",1
"To parents who are considering purchasing this game for your children: If you prefer your children to refrain from hearing occasional profane language or references to sex, this would NOT be a good choice! I let my kids play it at a friend's house, and after trying a few songs, they found some that were more appropriate, like Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock 'N Roll."" Regarding learning rhythm in music, it's a phenomenal tool for teaching children or adults, but I just wish they provided a larger selection of songs that aren't as ""nasty."" It is definitely a fun game, but the content definitely has me concerned. Wish they'd come out with a version for families like us who are offended by some of the songs on this first version of Guitar Hero. It is what it is, and that's what most of it is: offensive.",0
"Fun to Play. The Guitar that you play is inventive and fun. But the songs contain language, drug references, and innuendos. The music is somewhat bad, and all of the characters are goth. Fun premise but...",0
"This game is so much fun. Everyone in my family was loving it (ages 31,30, 10,9,7,4)even my 4 year old loved to watch us play. Having said that, we've decided to get rid of it. I let some of the lyrics and the sexiness slide at first, but as the game when on, the satanic stuff was introduced. Most people don't think it's a big deal, BUT IT IS. I shouldn't have bought the game with the T rating. That was my fault. I'm just alarmed at how many people think it's ok for kids. I would by this game for every family I know if there were a version aimed at kids.",0
Our entire family LOVES this game,1
"Beware of connecting your kids through some of the bands (e.g., Slayer) which has songs about Nazis, suicide, death, and devil worship. My son bought the bands music on ITunes because he played one of their songs on Guitar Hero - these songs were totally inappropriate and disgusting.",0
"This game is about as well made as you will ever find in the strategy genre. It isn't too difficult to pick up and play, but if you want to get good at it it takes a lot of time and thought. Not really much to worry about for kids. On a positive note it might just get them interested in history...or maybe that's expecting too much. Either way it's a great game that will eat up loads of your time. You've been warned. :)",1
"Civilization IV, in my opinion, is the greatest strategy game ever created.
Unfortunately, due to its slow-paced nature and steep learning curve, it's generally only played by adults and especially patient children or teenagers. If your kids can get into this game though, that's fantastic. They are of a dying breed.",1
"This is a strategy game that spans human history and will expose young children to a sense of grandeur in world exploration, and a number of concepts that have been important over time. Gameplay is nothing like real life, of course, but the concepts of war and peace, wonders, technological development, and cultural growth are all positive. The 'civilopedia' is a great way to have your kid reading about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or the development of railroads or somesuch enriching topic during their play time. And Leonard Nimoy will read them quotes from great works of literature, too.
My Dad got me Civ I when I was nine. I couldn't quit playing. That may sound terrible but getting engrossed in a topic of interest can be a good experience, and this was for me. I learned plenty and had a lot of fun--a very wholesome game. If your child is completely unfamiliar with concepts like war or barbarians, or the variety of religions in history, you may want to provide a little guidance on those topics.",1
"This toy is marketed for 6 months plus. That's pretty wild to me. Sure you as a parent can put a book in here and your kid can hear the words being read and look at the pictures and words but they will not be very engaged with it for long. My daughter got this as a gift as a 9 or 12 month old and didn't like it at all. We were pulling it out to give it away and then she found it and started playing with it as a 4 year old and loves it. She loves the questions it asks about the story, which are quite easy for her to answer at this age, and she always gets them right which is fun for kids this age. We have the Sesame Street books and are ordering the Winnie the Pooh ones because she loves it so much.",1
"Anyone of any age can touch the many plankton on the screen and make some beautiful or interesting sounds. There are two modes that allow you to record from the microphone for more fun and variety.
It can get old, as there is no story or real goals, but it is always good for a few minutes of fun.",1
This game is too easy and when you defeat Bowser and he falls in the lava pit he melts into skeletal remains that writhe as he dies which is very graphically depicted for a regular DS game. I remember years ago it gave my younger cousin who was about 5 at the time nightmares about skeletons and dying in lava. It's not like the original NES game because it leaves nothing to the imagination. The game should have at least gotten an E-10 rating for ages 10 and up because of the violent images... Did I mention how easy it is too?,0
"I love it. I haven't played all of the worlds yet, but have watched my dad play them. My favorite character is Luigi. I like what Mario says when I start and end a game...""Itsame, Mario!"" and ""Bye, bye!"".",1
"kids love this game, still fight over. if more than 2 kids download you have to do mini games",1
kids will do fine until the higher levels but that's the way all games are.,1
"the game is fun and well made. boys will probably start getting intrested in mario when they are 4 or 5 but i do not recomend getting them the game at that age wate till there atleast 6. and girls (if they like video games) will probably start getting intrested in it at the age of 8,7, or maybe 6 at which time the game is age apropreat. also note that there is vilonce but saftey will never be an issue and that the game will be easy to play if your child is 6 or older.",1
"I have this game, and it's one of the best games for DS. It has a lot of levels and is very challenging, which I like. Also, it has a lot of minigames when you don't want to play the actual game. My favorite thing about the game is 2-Player. I play this all the time with my friends.",1
"My three year old son recently got a Nintendo DS and absolutely loves Super Mario Bros!! It so sad because he is better at it than I am!! When he gets stuck at one of bowsers castles he may ask for my help, but after seeing my kill off poor Mario, he says ""That's ok, you just have to try again..."" followed by ""hey, I know what I'm doing now, give it back."" I'm amazed at how good he is at this game for his age!",1
"Def Jam Icon is an interesting game to say the least. It has great graphics and a very innovative play style; however, the game is very short and can become boring after a couple hours of gameplay. If you want to play the game, I say rent it, instead of spending the 60$ on it.",1
"I was in high school when the first GTA came out, and honestly it wasn't overly enticing. I played Doom mostly. This was my first GTA, so perhaps I'm a little biased to say that this is one of if not the best in the series. The graphics are a little dated with time, but the story and gameplay are quite solid, if you're into the Scarface/Godfather/Boardwalk Empire little-Mafia-nobody-works-his-way-to-kingpin story, and like open-world exploration games. The humor is one of the key values to this title; I've literally just spent an hour or more with my character sitting in a car listening to the parody talk radio and ridiculous commercials. It's little things like that which make a good game great. As a game, I give this a solid 5 stars.
As far as age goes, you really need to know your own child and monitor accordingly. My 11yo is impulsive and copies anything he sees in a game. He does Fortnite dances everywhere and always starts Minecraft reenactments with friends and talks incessantly about whatever Mario or Zelda game he's playing. We let him play Terraria at around 8-9 and had to throttle back because he would rattle on endlessly about walls of flesh and eyes of Cthulhu at the bus stop in front of other parents. I doubt we'll let him play any GTA until he's well into high school, lest we get calls from the principle saying he's playing a spirited game of drive-over-the-whore in the cafeteria. Now, if you have the sort of well-behaved child who is full of self control and can watch Freddy and Jason movies without forgetting that games involving accidentally stabbing one another with pencils are inappropriate for school, you might start yours on this a little younger. If you're the sort of parent who wretches at the idea that your child could be exposed to any alcohol/violence/drugs/cursing/sexual references, why are you even here? Vice City is a gritty game that's caught all kinds of heck for being inappropriate, violent, etc. Playing this game you will most certainly kill people of various races and genders, including innocent bystanders and police officers. You will use guns, lots of guns, including tanks and helicopters with guns. You will have the chance to pick up prostitutes. You will steal cars, as per the name of the game, and you will drive recklessly, and you will find almost no consequences for killing random people, and you will drive drunk. Coked up people will act obviously coked up. You will hear lots of bad words, threats, lies and so on, even to the extent that there will be swearing on public radio. If you would normally allow your child to experience these things and you believe your child is ready to consume this sort of media while still being responsible for their thoughts and actions, then you're ready to let them play GTA. Just make sure you have a good gauge of their emotional maturity and understand the implications of their development if you're wrong. IE: don't buy this for your grandchild you see once a year. I mean it grandma; he's too young!",0
Bash innocent people with a baseball bat and steal their car. It goes downhill from there.,0
"Violence is the bases of this game. You can free roam around the city, killing anybody you want. You could even decapitated people with a sword or blow their heads off with a shotgun, and blood will be gushing all over. As well you could use other gruesome methods, such as a chainsaw. Though the swearing isn't as bad as other gta games, there's still a lot! No F words are used, but a lot of S***, b***, h***, d***, b***ard. Throughout the game you can pick up prostitutes. There is a strip club, but it is not as graphic as other gta games. There is a dance club you can go to, where you can see the bartender breasts (nipples are slightly covered). Drugs such as cocaine are used. The main plot of the game revolves around cocaine being lost in a drug deal.",0
"My 9 year old is being pressured by his school buddies to buy this game. I was not informed about this game before my son began begging for me to buy it for him. My answer is this game is definitely NOT for kids!!!!!
Do NOT allow your underaged kids to play this game. I will continue to let my 9 year old BE a 9 year old.

"Similar to most of Rockstar Games’ produces I’ve encountered (mainly the GTA franchise), GTA Vice City has strong language, lots of violence and a lot of things a 12-year old would not understand. I got my hands on this when I was... I’ll be brave and say 10, might’ve been younger, trough my mother. She told me to play and watched for a bit, saw me gut someone with a chainsaw and took the game away from me. Now, that I rethink it, she did only one mistake; when I was left home alone, I knew where the game was hidden... you can guess. She told me not long ago, that she knew I was playing it in secret. I wish she had stopped me... I’m not a violent person, but my language isn’t the cleanest, shall I say. But one thing is, I did learn English a lot from videogames, be it violent or not, I find that a good thing. As for the game itself, in short: Not for people under 18 years (in Finland, that’s the legal limit for alcohol and all them stuff).",0
"Unlike GTA IV AND V, this game has unrealistic violence with a side of infrequent bad language. crude references are rare apart from girls in bikinis.",0
"I just bought this for my son who is 17 because I used to play it, but as I went along and watched him play it, it really isn't as bad as games like saints row and call of duty. It doesn't have any nudity, it has a bit of language here and there but it isn't as bad as what kids here at school. Almost little to no drug use or references. My son loves this game. You should buy it for your 16+ year old!",0
"Violence is the bases of this game. You can free roam around the city, killing anybody you want. You could even decapitated people with a sword or blow their heads off with a shotgun, and blood will be gushing all over.",0
"I remember playing this game as a kid, probably way too young for this kind of games (like 11-12?) anyways, there is a lot of violence in the game, the use of drugs are present in the game, you are playing as a criminal in the game - There is no reason to present this game to anyone below the age of 14/15... And even that is pretty low, as kids do actually take role models from games - even if you think that they don't. Your parents letting you play adult games when you were a kid, is not a valid reason to let your kids play adult games - it is stupidity.
If your kids don't go shooting people after playing GTA it is not proof that playing these games did not affect them in anyway, it is just a part of bigger picture: To sum it up, this game contains bad role models,killing people in various ways,use of drugs, theft etc -This review is written by a young adult man who actively plays games.",0
Good for Children.,1
"I played Resident Evil 4 when I was about 10 and I did not think that it was scary at all, it has a few giants and maybe some scary looking parasites but that is mostly all. I would overall say that 10 and above is a good age rating even though it may have some blood and swearing in it",0
"My uncle bought it when i was very young (7 years) Game wasn't scary, it is violent but not too much, i didn't find it disturbing as a kid but still I wouldn't recommend to play this if you are younger than 12",0
This game is bloody. Frightening enemies with chainsaws as well as other enemies chase your character (aliesterrrr lol). Moderate cursing but nothing severe a few sexual innuendos.,0
"This is one of the greatest games of all time, but there is a lot of violence you should probably know about if your kids want to play it. A lot of the game is killing zombies but the most violent parts are ways for the player to die. Probably the worst is being decapitated by a chainsaw. But other than violence, there isn't too much cursing which surprised me with this being mature rated and there's not really any sexual content. Also, the main character, Leon could be considered a good role model. In one scene, he is offered a cigarette but says no. If your kids know right from wrong, they won't necome violent from playing this game and if they've played other M games it shouldn't be too shocking and disturbing for them. Because this is a horror game it might scare some people but it won't emotionally traumatize you. If your kids wake you up in the middle of the night because they have nightmares they probably shouldn't play it but if not, and you know they are mature enough, go ahead and let them play it. This is one of the best games of all time, you don't even have to be a fan of survival horror games to enjoy it, I don't usually play horror games but this is really good. I let my 13 year old play it and he's not afraid of it, sometimes the jumpscares get him but only for like a second.",0
"Personally, I've noticed that EVERY M-rated game on here is instantly rated not for kids, and its a little biased. If anything, the movies are more gory, and have more swearing than the games themselves.",0
This is a fantastic game that has fairly significant violence and mild language. The worst of the language is in spanish. There are a few instances of s*** but nothing any worse. Enemy heads often explode but that is as bad as the violence gets. The game is intense but not necessarily scary which I found disappointing. If you are looking for a survival/horror game go somewhere else. This is an action game. It is not nearly as gore as Gears of War but it is slightly worse than Call of Duty. Know your kids. If they play Call of Duty without issue this should be fine.,0
"Ok, I'm not going to touch gameplay until later on (because quite frankly, the vast majority of this site's audience couldn't care less). First issue is language. Yeah, they swear, it's on the box M for strong language. That said, it's nothing too bad and more importantly, nothing your kids haven't heard before if they have any interaction whatsoever with other kids.
Next is the violence. And boy is there a lot. From the satisfying explosion of a perfect headshot to the death of your character at the hands of the chainsaw wielding maniac, this game is violent. That said, it's not overly violent (like, say, Saw). The genre of the game is survival horror, and the dark element adds to the game perfectly.
This game is scary, intense, well-made, hard, and not good for anyone who scares easily. It's a fantastic game, one of my personal favorites, and by no means the worst one out there. You want really violent? Try Dead Space. (also a great game, just gorier)
Finally, the sexual content. I don't understand why everyone is getting so worked up over it. Ashley dresses in a miniskirt. The game is made in Japan. Miniskirts are normal there, and her skirt is actually quite modest by comparison (trust me, I was there)
Oh, and as for gameplay, I recommend ign.com's excellent review. It describes the game far better than I ever could.",0
"Resident Evil 4 is too funny to be taken seriously. The dialogue parodies American rhetoric in the ""war on terror"" perfectly. The violence may be a little shocking perhaps, but it's too comic book to be serious. Overall, despite the gore, I wouldn't object to 10 year olds viewing some of it and certainly by the teen years it's not at all too much",0
"Resident Evil 4 is widely and critically considered to be one of the greatest games ever made, but it is definitely not for kids. This game is extremely violent, as you would expect in a Resident Evil title. As Leon you will kill countless infected (not zombies) humans through gunfire and melee. There are graphic head explosions, dismemberment, beheadings (some via chainsaw) and other violent deaths including having your face melted off. It is definitely not for those who are easily sickened, as a majority of the violence includes parasites and grotesque monsters that explode out of human bodies. Outside of violence, there is mild sexual innuendo and women in provocative dress and infrequent mild to strong language (with the worst being sh**). For those who love action games or survival horror, this game is amazing, and is a must play for any game collector.",0
i could see where one would think not a positive message but actually think about the story. a guy goes to spain on a mission to rescue the presidents daughter all of the people in this area are infected of course you are gonna shoot em! you rescue her and stop the bad guys from taking over the world there is swearing but its another hero story not a lets go shoot people like gta,0
"A lot of fun, not for young kids at all. Besides the violence and a few swear words, there isn't too much wrong with the game. It's not Grand Theft Auto or anything like that. Most teenagers should be fine with it.",0
"My 6 year old boy was very entertained by this game. It kept his attention and wasn't too hard. It even gives hints when he was stuck.
I was very pleased to find a game he enjoyed while increasing his skills in math, english, and logic.
This game was very well designed to increase the childs knowledge while not letting the child fail or get frustrated if he can't find the correct answer.
Now, if the game only had a remote for me, to turn it off, so I can get him to come to dinner... ;)",1
"We all like the Harry Potter series, the first game was iffy, the second a improvment and the third amazing, if anything half-linear games are my favorite, but the fourth was different, it was completaly linear and the jinxs were especially confusiing, the list goes on and on, you have to be plain lucky to cast the right jinx, although the new card equip feture is quite good, although too much like Fred and Georges shop in the old one, the overall apperance of the creatures is amazing, they are really good, the variation of them is apsolutley amazing.
Overall: Not as good as the 3rd",1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the worst of 5 Harry Potter games.No exploring Hogwarts.No dueling.And horrible graphics.The children could be into it if they like the game called Shrek The Third or The Chronicles of Narnia the lion the witch and the Wardrobe.In GOF players cast charms with the square button and jinxes with the X button wich is eisier than downloading to a wand or using a pad to cast a spell in the other games.The 2 most violent levels to me are The Second Task and Voldemort oh and The Forbidden Forest.,1
"Although rated 10+, my 6 year old couldn't stop playing this game until he'd completed it. I loved the fact that he had to think to complete the challenges and work together with others to suceed. The scenes are much darker than the previous games, but that didn't seem to put my son off who just enjoyed being able to use his wand more. Great for Harry Potter fans!",1
"I love it, and I would say about all ages 8+ could play this. Now I don't even like Harry Potter, but I LOVE the video game(s)!!!!",1
"This game is great for many ages, because their is a bit of 'fake' violence, where people are just knocked unconscious. Also, their are positive messages. For example, Harry's friends want to go into the face of danger to help him. This is a good Harry Potter fan game.",1
i love it its just hard to move the wand in the exact way they want you to!!!,1
this is more for a little bit more mature group and not such children.,0
"I bought this for my kids and also have played through 80% of the game myself. We've enjoyed the PC versions of Harry Potter. The big attraction with this Wii version is the ablity to actually cast spells using the remote as a wand. If your 9+ child enjoys Harry Potter, they'll love this game just for all that wand waving. Younger kids may have trouble with the coordination and the level of logic and thought that's required to complete this game.
There are very few battle sequences and you ""win"" when the other characters fall down. No blood, no contact. Not particularly ""violent"" to me.
There are mini-games and puzzles that kids will enjoy along the way. Because the game is non-linear, players can do as much or as little as they want. Some kids might enjoy just walking around.
Now my negative thoughts. As part of the background action, students are walking around all over Hogwarts and you can hear them talking. The Slytherins are relentless in their insults. Frankly, as a mom, I get really tired of hearing voices coming out of my tv saying over and over ""can he look any more stupid?"" There are *lots* of these, so you might want to talk with your kids about what is and is not acceptable. The put-downs really wear me out.
Another issue I have is actually a bit ironic. The game ony allows for 3 saved games at a time. So if you have more than 3 kids that want to play, one will have to wait (maybe weeks, depending on how fast your other players complete the game). I can't understand why EA would do this, except I was tempted to get another copy for our family.",1
"This is a good game for my nearly six-year-old son. I especially like that when he makes a mistake, instead of having to start over from the beginning of the game, he is transported back to where he just played. This eases the usual frustration factor of playing this type of game.",1
Classic Kart racing with tons of slapstick comedy. This is in the big selection of kart games of consumerism.,1
"Great game. I've played Mario Kart ever since it's debut on the Super Nintendo (which I still have). If you're going to get your kid a DS for his/her birthday, include this great game with it.",1
Driving controls are easy for younger ones and the courses are entertaining,1
"Totally fun!! Almost as good as Mario Kart 64 (which will always be the best, in my opinion)",1
"I really love that me and my kids can share this game - we play head-to-head on our two ds' and it's just a generally fun sort of game with no questionable content.
Much better than a lot of the stuff on the market today.",1
the game was a great addtion to my ps3 line-up,1
"Good for a 6 year old who is a good reader but boring for anyone over 8 or 9. The puffles are cute. My kids are boys, so they like playing a secret agent.",1
"Ok, but really TIME CONSUMING. I bought this for my kids and my sister's kids, but my kids never got into it. They were too young at the time to understand what was going on at the game. But my sister's kids NEVER stopped playing this. And the game was really just about getting people to play the website.",1
"My daughter's a big fan of Club Penguin and I bought this as a little treat. It's a very quirky, sweet game and is good because it's portable and means I can get her out of the house easier. :)
The game play is good and I've even tried the minigames myself, lots of good fun :)",1
"Valkyria Chronicles is a unique game, being set in a World-War-2 era fantasy world. The story borrows some themes from this turbulent time period, but is not a one-to-one allegory for the actual conflict. However, many of the negative effects of the war, such as the killing of civilians, and even racial discrimination and genocide are depicted. That being said, the oversimplified dialogue and generally campy tone at times can detract from the serious atmosphere.
Violence: During combat, soldiers use guns, tanks, and explosives to annihilate each other. bullet impacts are highlighted by small splashes of orange, which could potentially be blood, but it's unclear. Most deaths are nothing more than a character getting shot and falling over, but the game makes many attempts to humanize every soldier who is felled. If a player controlled unit is fatally wounded, the game will focus on the dying troop, giving them a few last words before they pass on. The player can no longer use characters who are killed, and while they are largely expendable from a strategic perspective, they still are people. The story portrays some of the cold realities of war, with a few scenes showing unarmed, scared civilians being gunned down by Nazi-esque invaders. A few children even die, albeit not in graphic detail. There is an entire subplot about racism/bigotry, as a fictional race of people known as ""Darcsens"" who are Caucasian in appearance, but all have navy blue hair, face discrimination and persecution from both sides of the war. The Darcsens seem to be a stand in for the European Jewish population, as they are made into scapegoats and oppressed by the evil ""Empire"" (Nazis) and are even shown being forced into concentration camps at one point.
Positive messages/ Role models: The game depicts war as a tragedy, but emphasizes that good things can happen in even the most dire circumstances. Ultimately arguing that all people can do during times of hardship (the war) is try to make the best of things, and help each other. Unlike the war the game was inspired by, women are allowed to participate in the army in this world, and are generally portrayed as being equally capable to men. The cast seems to be primarily white, but the story tackles the concept of bigotry through the aforementioned fictional Darcsens. Over the course of the story, we see examples of even the ""good guys"" treating this minority group poorly, and making assumptions based on stereotypes. These assumptions are played up as inaccurate and baseless, and ultimately most characters do learn to be more tolerant.
Sexuality: Some female characters wear short skirts. One scene depicts both men and women in revealing swim suits.
Tobacco Use: One character occasionally smokes a cigar.",0
"This game has a very mature view on war and death. The violence is bloodless and non-graphic but very frequent, and each of the player's soldiers are treated as unique people, so to lose a soldier can be truly heart-wrenching. This might upset some children. The game has several very positive role models, and throughout the course of the game your squad members overcome differences and grow both as a team and as individuals.",0
"Interesting game, fun for child to learn about animal habitats and how different decisions make an impact thru the ecosystem. It was pretty easy to join my child and play together, although it takes some coordinating, which is also great. However, like some others have said, she was sad when some of her favorite animals die (it's always difficult, isn't it, after you name an animal?) and eventually she was so concerned about the toxic spill and its effect that she didn't want to play anymore! But she did enjoy it for quite a while and some kids wouldn't be especially bothered by these things. I may be reaching here, but it also has a positive message that people can make the earth more livable and protecting wildlife is a great thing.",1
"Not really sure how to rate this. My daughter rented it and I thought my younger son would hate it (no action) but he played it almost as much as she did. They seemed to have a lot of fun but a lot of it seemed repetitive and boring to me when I watched (although they had no complaints). Both kids felt like they would be able to beat the game really quickly so it may not be worth buying. I wouldn't exactly call it educational, although it did touch on some environmental topics. Easy to play if you can read &amp; follow directions. Fairly intuitive. Sensitive kids might get stressed over the idea of ""their"" animal getting eaten by predators. The animals are kind of cute... nothing really bad but nothing outstanding either.",1
"You'd expect it to be the exact same thing as Sims... but it's almost the opposite. It's fun for the first 15 minutes, but then it's boring. The beaver level is impossible. (I think...)",1
"It's easy enough so that little kids can play, but also challenging in later levels for adults like me. There is nothing objectionable, and the graphics are gorgeous!!",1
"This game is classic Street Fighter with plenty of freshness to keep it from feeling trite. The aesthetics are astounding and the gameplay is, for the most part, well balanced.
With 25 characters in all, there's a fighter (or several) suited for any player. Online Vs. battle is where it's at, offering players the chance to test their merit against other players all over the world.
Highly recommended, for veterans and newcomers alike!",1
"Fire Emblem is probably my favorite DS game of all time . I love it but it has too much talk about death, revenge, and destruction for kids under 8 years old.",1
"Okay, this is a good game, don't get me wrong. It's just not as good as the first two games were for the GBA. The ability to rescue characters is now gone, the Dancer/Bard class is gone, there's just a lot of nice details from the first two games is missing in this one. As far as gameplay goes, it's primarily the same, except for the addition of using the touch screen to movie your characters, though it seems easier to just use the buttons to me. As far as appropriateness goes, it think it's okay for maybe 10+. Some rather brief language, mild violence, though the talk of death, darkness &amp; world domination is pretty overwhelming, &amp; a few mild suggestive themes (a few girls have semi-skimpy outfits). Also, like the site said it's got a pretty complex reading level so younger kids probably won't get the story much (heck, I'm 17 &amp; I didn't even know some of the words in this game).",0
this arcade game sonic's ultimate genesis collection is a great and fun demo game from the year 1991 back when the sega genesis games came out this demo game is good for your young kids to enjoy the only thing this arcade game has is some cartoon violence.,1
"This is a huge jump from Killzone a ps2 limit pushing shooter with language and minimal blood.
As far as tech and adult themes this goes way beyond.
Firstly blood is about 3 times and much seen headshots can be gory and often best for survival.
Melee is not to bloody, but explosives can be and there are scripted deaths in form of executions and suicide.
The cursing is greater there is also a fair bit of sexual innuendo and crude humor.
I would let my kids play this but keep an eye out if you want to keep them from too much violence.
There is also a good deal of thematic or scary/disturbing situations as this is pretty much a war epic.
Basically its rated r just like a scifi war movie
Oh on the technical side you must use a real PS3 controller with sixaxis to play!",0
"Lots of blasphemy and using the name of our lord in vain every 3 -4 times you get shot
too many profanities to mention
the violence is really high it is way too violent than the first game you can even poke soldiers eyes or even through a sniper rip someones head off.
it is an unhealthy game there are other games that are not as gory. it shows you how horrible is war.
the graphics are truely amazing one of the best graphics i have seen but the blasphemies is just too much there is also a level where one of the bad guys commits suicide.
this game is not for anyone due to the violence as well as profanity and blasphemies.
even one of the bad guys shoots a woman in game.
I recommend other games.",0
"Killzone 2 is a ps3 and a very mature version of halo. Its even scary in a way. As you can see from the cover. You aren't smelling flowers and planting them. You are planting heads. There is decapitation and an over the top amount of blood. I wouldn't say gory, But bloody. There is more blood than Call of duty MW2. But this has extreme stuff. The language is really bad, F words every ten seconds, Its too mature for anyone young. Overall its just mature, Not for kids.",0
"To be clear to any complaining about the violence, you have no right to. There is a reason there is a big fat M stamped on this game. It is a very violent game with mature language but it also a very good one. Excellent tactical multiplayer and single player with some of the best graphics ever in a game, second only to crysis and maybe uncharted 2. If you can handle strong language and an almost GeoW2 level of gore this is an excellent choice.",0
"Look, this is one I will not review, simply because it doesn't need it. There is a reason that there is a big T stamped on the front of this game. RECOMMENDED FOR TEENS 17 AND OLDER! Folks, do not, and I mean DO NOT, take the advice of another person, you have to choose what is appropriate for your kids. When your kid asks you to buy them a game, ask the person at the store (or go to esrb.com) to let you see the game, turn it over, and look at the M on the back where it lists everything in this game. That is there job, and they are payed to do it, they don't just skip around, remember, the ESRB is the game version of the same ratings you see on movies and TV shows.",0
this is a very violent but entertaining game with great online I play this a lot but the fact is it's very graphical for children some of the best graphics in the ps3 unless your kid knows the difference between what's fake and whats real.,0
"I just bought this game a few days ago with my son and he loves it. I am concerned about the bad language but I know my son knows its just a game. The violence is not that ugly because blood and bodies just go away after some time. The online play is fantastic and you get to hang out with all your friends.
After a long wait I think Killzone 2 was as good as everyone expected it to be.",0
"This game is a brand new shooter just relased for the Playstation 3. Fans have been waiting for this game sense about 2006 and now that it is out it is very exciting. This game does have violence and bad language but if you have children around 14 I think its a good game. I think most kids know that it is just a game and that this is not real. The blood in the game is very fake and dead bodies and blood disapear after just seconds. The language is bad,but if your kids have heard these words before it is ok and they understand it is just a game. To conclude this review Killzone 2 is a beautiful and probaly the best looking game on the Playstation 3 and is a definatly worth the $60.",0
fireboy and watergirl top my list of favorite games from hudgames,1
this is one of my favourite games of all time.,1
"This game is awsome i recomend it 12+, it's a game where you can learn about History after around an hrs play i got stuck into it, it took me 30 mins to get to know the basics, i rate it 15.9 / 20.00 It doesn't cost much, i got mine at: www.rewards1.com/index.php?referrer_id=1116923 Just make an account and do the offers, it should take 20 mins to get the points to buy the game, it's a trusted website mcaffee knows about this website. And even they support it. What are you waiting for?",1
"This is, quite literally, the best thing ever. Everyone needs to experience this for themselves. Any student of history needs this.",1
The game was originally purchased for my 6 year old as a birthday gift. It was too hard for him after the first few levels so he passed it to our 8 year old until he was older. My older child really enjoyed using the puzzle to super charge the attacks on the top screen. It took a little bit to understand how to flop the blocks of the puzzle. (It feels much different than other match 3 games.) Once we figured it out it was addicting. This is a game worth buying!,1
I believe that this game is very age appropriate! It is a fast paced beat game that is VERY easy to pick up! The only thing that concerns me is that there word fugly (freaking ugly)! But otherwise a great game!,1
i'ts along story but still very enjoyable and i finished this game for only a few months!,1
i like this game. they make cool sounds. i just can't beat the red gragon. or the blue dragon.so dragons you sting.,1
i think this game is pretty ok.,1
"We love this EA Active (yes, even better than Wii Fit)because it gives us opportunity to do workouts together that is ""customizable"" and more varied (ie. sports, cardio, upper body, lower body)than Wii Fit with regards to creating your favorite workout. The trainers come out in PIP (picture and picture)so it is easy to follow. The characters although adult looking, are more realistic than Wiifit characters. The trophies given after achieving goals are very encouraging. The workouts vary from easy to hard and would mirror an active workout that you would do in a class of circuit training and cardio in sport clubs. My 5 year old enjoyed playing this due to the trophies he gets from persisting to play different games (ie. first hour trophy, baseball batting x 200 etc)",1
A Must read book for every 8 Year Old,1
"I have not yet completed the game, but I did want to clarify the rating above.
***SPOILER ALERT****
In the middle of the game, there is a cutscene in which Jason rescues Claire from a captor. He enters the room, shoots the captor in the head - blood is visible. This scene was more graphic than the actual gameplay.",0
"Suitable for gamers of all ages, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is a wonderful gaming experience that combines puzzles, mysteries, and a knack for adventure.",1
"So I was at Kmart one day,and was looking at the video games for my Nintendo DS.This game really caught my eye.So since I had extra money,I spent it on this game.When I got home,I played this game,and it was SO AWESOME! Everything about it was perfect from the levels to the music!",1
"This game requires skill, but, as with many other games, practice makes perfect. I am especially fond of the Giga-Bowser battles, since you have to use your physical abilities, such as quick reflexes and long periods of blowing into the microphone. If you like combined genres, then this is the game for you! -10 year old",1
"This is what Partners in Time SHOULD have been, a sequel that's actually better than its predecessor. You will be amazed with how much you can do in this game. While Partners in Time was too short, this one can take well over 20 hours to beat. Also, while Partners in Time had you constantly reusing the same concepts outside of battle over and over again, only introducing one new feature in each area, this game introduces something new, even putting a unique spin on the old concepts, every 5-30 minutes. Also, it's not just one plot. What made Superstar Saga interesting was that there was more than one storyline going on. PIT kinda felt rushed as there were few plotholes and they just dove right into the ""collect stars"" storyline. Also, this game doesn't hand you the three stars. You actually have to work for them whereas PIT gave you the last 2 Cobalt Star Shards after making you deal with all kinds of torment getting the first 3. Also, the Bros Attacks: In PIT, Nintendo introduced this horrid idea called Bros Items. That meant after using a Bros Attack, you'd need to find another copy of it before you could use it again. Luckily, this game brought up the Bros Point system and even introduces more inventive Bros Attacks than PIT had. Sure, they'll never be as cool as the ones from SSS, but at least they did a better job with this one. Anyway, I could go on and on, but I've said enough. You really gotta play this game. This should have been game of the year, not Scribblenauts! It's the sequel we should have gotten from the start.",1
"MySims Agents is a rather ordinary but well-executed puzzler. The styling and interface work well in disguising the average nature of the storyline, which is no more complicated than that of a Rogue-like text game from the 1980s. Kids will find interest in the mildly absurd and humorous situations and in the characters' interaction. It should work well for any child old enough to read and understand the clues that are handed out by the odd denizens of this game. It can be used to introduce some vocabulary for the younger players. The game will not be terribly interesting to anyone over 13 or old enough to realise that the game's problem solving is purely mechanical and not intuitive.",1
"My girls, 7 and 9 received this game for Christmas. They say it is fantastic. We've liked all the MySims games and this is more good stuff. There is a lot of reading involved to stay on top of the narrative, so younger players may need a parent or older sibling to help them follow along. With lots of suspense and mystery, my kids say it's one of the best games they've ever played.",1
"Among Thieves is the 2nd chapter or a sequel to an already great title called Uncharted. It was created by Naughty Dogs, the same company behind the Playstation's iconic mascot Crash Bandicoot. The Uncharted 2 game is simply the best in the series, it's a 3rd person shooter mixed with an epic treasure hunting journey that is second to none. The story in this game is very well done. The visual graphics is also a big improvement from the first. The music and sound effects is very good. The gameplay is pretty easy, you control a treasure hunter named Nathan Drake and you take him and his team to an exciting and thrilling adventure near the country of Nepal. Just like the story of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft's Tomb Raider, any Uncharted title is a must have for all Playstation owners out there.",1
"Graphics are really good, story line is great, it has very beautiful music.
I like how fluid the game is.
However the level of blasphemies is not worth it it is what ruins this game.
It uses the Holy name of Our Lord in vain as in a negative connotation.
When nathan opens his diary and you go to Sulley's (basically a friend of the protagonist)pages you read that in almost every sentence they use the name of God in a blasphemous manner while they try to be humorous. The drawing gs are humorous but the quote of using the name of God to condemn is not humorous that was highly offensive. They should have used another word or some other expression.
Why use blasphemies I do not understand.
Unfortunately, There is without giving details a very sensual conversation in one main scenes. (Nothing visible nor shown. I felt uncomfortable so I ended up skipping the scene. Whe you play it the first time it does not let you skip it so I turned off the screen.) (There is three inferences in a conversations) but one was the main one.
That main scene was not necessary.
The game It is violent but the violence is in a pg13 level. No blood.
If the game removed blasphemies and a scene of the conversation and the insinuations then the game it would have been more enjoyable and I would have given it a 5 star. However unfortunately that was not the case. And no there is no way to filter the profanity.
In the end I ended up getting rid of the game. It was not spiritually beneficial.",0
This is a brilliant game which is totally appropriate for anyone who has started secondary school because of its fun gaming and positive role model. I think that the violence is really not strong and seeing it I think that this game really should not be a 15,1
"Great 2nd part of the UC series! This game has just as much violence if not more violence compared to the first one. But now there are considerably more sexual references and movie sequences near the beginning of the game that would cause me not to let my teens play it until they are older anyway... There is violence, language (nothing changed from last game) and sexual referencing and movie cuts in a few parts of the game which cause me to not play it too much even when our kids (13, 11) are up and watching for parts of the game. I would recommend this to at least 14 or 15 yr olds, as long as they are talked to about what is inappropriate - and also you can skip any of the movie sequences you want by clicking start and skip, so another option would be to watch/be in the room when they play so when it looks like one of those scenes you can skip.",0
"It's a great, fun game with an awesome, cinematic story. It does get to be a little violent at times and the language is a bit of an issue. However it's nothing that would void PG-13 rating if it were a movie.",1
"A fantastic game, hours and hours of entertainment for anybody who is a fan of adventure games, especially if you love the Indiana Jones movies, this game feels like an interactive Indiana Jones 6, nr 5 was the first game in the series. also it does not contain a lot of blood, yes you can shoot and preform melee takedowns but it's nothing worse than movies rated 11+, or games rated age 12+, so enjoy what's visually the greatest game ever made, as everything looks 100% real, when you swim or roll in the water your clothes even get's wet and slow you down for a short amount of time until teh slowly and realistic dries up, also it's just so much fun to flank someone by climbing up a wall and pull him down! 3 more words: GET THIS GAME",1
"All I have to say is great game but don't let a 13 year old play this game, 15 to 16 ya, the language and blood is the biggest issue here.",0
"Uncharted 2 is one of the best games I've ever played, and I have an extensive library. It's Indiana Jones style adventure is laced with puzzles, action, creative and entertaining platforming, intense battles and cinematic moments on par with Hollywood. It's a beautiful game.
This game is a rather hard T rating though. Although you won't hear any F words, the game is full of sh**, da**, a**, etc. It isn't extremely violent, but there is blood, lots of shooting and some melee attacks have you choke or snap an enemy's neck. It also contains a lot of jokes involving sexual innuendo, although not strong (there is one scene where a girl sits on top of a guy in bed and sex is implied to happen later). The characters are all good people who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty, and what begins as a hunt for money and fortune becomes a quest to save the world.
This game is very well put together, easy to learn, fun to play, and even educational from a historical standpoint (very accurate). I definitely recommend it to anyone age 15 and up.",0
This is my son koji's favorite game. It is a hit in my house.,1
"It is my 13 year old son's favorite PS3 game...some cursing and violence, but nothing like Call of Duty or Halo...",0
the most innovated game ever in my life that i have played,1
"I enjoyed this game but I would strongly caution against it for young children. Within 2 minutes of playing the game myself an evil blob touched the boy (the character you play) and he falls to the ground dead. Although he's instantly resurrected for another round of the game, I found this image to be visibly jarring and was glad that I did not give my young children the game as I had originally planned. I have found that some ratings on games for this site (which I really like) have a grey area where a parent may be swayed a little older or younger on the age recommendations, but I would not on this one and may even bump it a year to age 9.
In the opening cut scene we also see the evil creatures which resemble black ghosts with ghoulish faces chasing the boy. This image may illicit some scary thoughts and bad dreams, so steer clear of this game for young children or kids that have challenges with fearful dreams. I believe that Boy and is Blob is also way too scary for young players.
The game itself is very enjoyable, but again only for 9 and up, in my opinion.",0
"The boy clearly exploits his blob without any concerns for it's safety. Along with feeding it a constant supply of jelly beans, instead of more health conscious foods, the blob gets eaten, jumped on, shoved in a backpack, carelessly thrown at enemies and spikes and abused. While the boy may hug the blob it could never make up for the pain the blob must feel on the inside.",0
"This is a great game. This was the first xbox game i bought and love it.You can play career mode that takes time.Or you could just Quick race and choose any car on the
game.However it may be hard for younger age groups(10-) to complete career.
To sum up it is a great game that can be fun and challenging!!!",1
"Content wise, this game is broad and chock-full of great game play, but the realism of driving (and having to actually slow down for a turn) may prove too difficult for younger children. Also, if you dont win races consistently, leveling up will be difficult, which will leave you stuck in a Ford Focus/ VW Golf type car when you want a Ferrari.",1
"I love the video game New Super Mario Brothers.When I bought the game at Best Buy,I heard some of the people in line praising to game.So I couldn't wait to play! Guess what? When I first played it,I LOVED IT! Awesome levels,and ease of play!",1
"Fun game to play at parties and events. However, people have been known to get really rowdy over the multiplayer aspect of the game, so be careful.",1
A little bit of a learning curve for a 5 year old but after about a week he was more than adept at the skills needed to play.,1
"While the controls are generally easy to master, my youngest gets very frustrated with the game because he can't ""do"" a lot of the things his older brother can on this game. This can often times lead to fighting between my boys because the older one is able to play a lot faster and better than the younger one and doesn't like to wait for the little one to ""catch up."" For ages 6 and up, when the hand-eye coordination is a little bit better, this game is a tremendous amount of good, clean fun.",1
i love it because it is easy and there is no cursing in the game.that is why i love it.,1
"I can't stop Nintendo as New Super Mario Bros. Wii gets my GOTY 2009.
Question will Wii make it five in a row?.",1
My son loves the challenges of this game but it can be frustrating for him at times.,1
"I have a 4 year old, 6 year old and 7 year old. The four and six year olds LOVE To watch, but don't seem quite old enough to really play yet. My 7 year old loves it because he can either play with me or by himself! We can't wait for the younger boys to want to play as well!",1
Everyone in our family loves this game. I highly recommend it. Lots of challenges but not to hard that our preschooler doesn't advance. Huge hit!,1
Great family game. Nothing to worry about for your kids. Just a 2D mario game!,1
My kids love it. They play it often and it's a great low on violence inclusive game.,1
I was thrilled to see this game come out. It's one that myself and my almost ten year old son can play together.It's not difficult to grasp the game and how to do the actions but it does get more difficult as the levels go on.,1
my 2yr old loves it....my 5yrold cant wait for family time,1
Very similar to Super Mario Brothers on the older Nintendo system. This updated spin on that hugely successful title is very enjoyable for every member of the family to play. Fun for hours of fun. May be difficult or frustrating for some kids under 6 but not inappropriate in any way. One of the best games ever for any system.,1
"i like this game because i played it and played ¨The Original Adventures¨
but when i try to load my save data it just says my save data is damaged and cannot be used, I think that there should be a solution to this problem I now use a USB Flash drive to solve the problem when i play the game with my save data on my flash drive It works right!",1
"I have tried various video games with my 4-year old son, who absolutely loves to play games on the iphone/ipad, and wanted to try something more ""substantial"". Almost all of the titles aimed at his age group (early development, such as sesame street, etc), are not only boring for him (a cardinal sin, clearly), but almost impossible for him to control. He has a really hard time with the wii remote, particularly in any aiming/pointing task. That being said, this game is great. He finds it really fun and engaging, and he's quite adept at the ps3 controller. The drop-in/drop-out and open world cooperative play allow him to explore on his own, with me to help him with anything too hard. We love playing it together. After a month or two of playing together, it's now usually him that wants to do all but the trickiest of challenges. As all characters are made of lego bricks, even the ""violence"" isn't really so, merely bricks separating, etc. Over all, the best thing about this game, and games in this series in general, is it allows us to play together, something that we both like and are challenged by. Highly recommended.",1
I like it better than lego starwars. Fun game. I really enjoy playing split-screen because you can go to different parts of the map without dragging your partner around with you.,1
"I have played Lego games on the xbox360 with my now 8 year old son for at least 2 years, and they are great. There is a lot of general mayhem and running around, collecting coins, etc. The violence is no more that what the kids do when play acting with physical lego pieces, and there is some good problem solving also required. I also think that the 9+ rating is too high, and that kids will lose interest in this game if they are older than 10. The female role models are not great, and some resort to kissing to defeat their enemies and are indicated by stereotypical conventions. My 10 year old daughter quickly lost interest in the lego games a year ago.",1
"The raters are right, this game is not for kids... under the age of 10. I got this game for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Im not one of those parents who let their kids get whatever they want. Violence- in the game people will die, but on the good side blood is not that bad. it doesnt ""gush"" out (not like just cause 2) like they say up there. I let my kid get just cause 2 as his first M game because its not that bad, but its worse than this game. Of course you stab people but its not bad at all. Blood is not an issue if you have seen any action movie. (die hard is a good example)Sex- it is not an issue!!!!!! if you watch comedy central for 30 minuets, its worse than this, there are prostitutes you can hire to distract guards, but the only part of of them that are showing is there legs. everything and i mean EVERYTHING is covered besides that. Language-they say the F-word 5 times 3 in the biging one at the end, and one in the middle in italian! the s-word is not used more than 10 times but d*mn, godd*mnit, and h*ll are used frequently, those are the only words, (and crap).
Drinking-wine is only showed.
Overall- this game is appropriate for thirteen yearolds if they have seen at least 1 action movie, (or played just cause 2 which my son loves)",0
"Fun game, might make children a bit more interested in history, has good messages, can be inspiring for some people, although hooded teens doing parkour and jumping off buildings thinking may not be such a great thing, as if children are that stupid.",1
"I got this is the ezio collection PS4 for my birthday and although you may be momentarily disturbed by the last gen graphics, playing he game will give you a free experience. There is some violence and brutal takedowns but not as brutal as its follower , brotherhood, but it is still violent. Sexual references and Italian swearing are also frequent.",0
"Assassins Creed 2 is a brilliant game in terms of the graphics, the animation, and the sound. But I definitely think that this title is not for kids because when you kill someone in the game play the body doesn't fade away, and the kills can sometimes be quite graphic, for example you can get close ups of the blade piercing someones chest or throat.",0
"I bought my kids this game and i watched them play,and i did NOT see anything wrong with this game. You just fight bad guys. This is the same as halo and call of duty. I did not see any sex in this game. I think this game should be rated T.",1
"While reviewing Assassin's Creed 2, I asked myself this question; what age would this game have been appropriate for me? Would I give this to myself at age 13? I am 17 now and after playing the game I would not give it to any kid younger than 15. Violence could be an issue but you can turn the blood off. The main reasons I would only approve this game for 15+ teens is because of the language and sex. The sexual content is not as bad as Common Sense makes it sound. In the beginning of the game, you undress a women but it show no nudity nor does it show the actual act of sex. There are many ""courtesans"" roaming the streets but you can not noting inappropriate with them nor do you ever see them doing such acts. The language would probably be the biggest problem if I were a parent. There are about four f-bombs dropped in the first 10 minutes of game play. After that, the vast majority of cursing is done in Italian, which,if you cut the subtitles off, you won't be able to understand. Notwithstanding, the game is awesome. Just make sure you, or your teen, is mature enough to handle this game.",0
"Very in depth game with amazing life and a historical feel. The missions were challenging and fun. However, the constant and blatant attacks on the Christian church left a bad taste in my mouth. Every priest was a drunkard or villain. It even had a nun as a madame of a brothel. And in the end your mission is to assassinate the main antagonist, the Pope.",0
"This game is very well made but not for kids. I would recomend getting the kids Brotherhood or Revelations because this games violence is all out of revenge and that may not be good for kids to learn. It includes one brief adult scene and some sex references too. There is cussing too, at least 2 f words in english and the rest are in Italian. The most violent this game ever gets are in two cutscenes, one in which a nobleman is ambushed and stabbed multiple times in the chest(very bloody), and the second is when a man is pinned to the ground with a sword through his neck(also very bloody) then your character finishes puts him out of his misery. OK for 16. This game also teaches you about the Italian Renaissance Very well.",0
Very good game. Some sex scenes and language. Doesnt show much in sex scenes,0
"A fascinating game. Great graphics, fun to play, a lot of bang for your buck. You are an assassin in Renaissance Italy, so there is blood, weaponry, etc. While you can kill civilians, the game discourages you by punishing you for killing too many. Ezio does have pre-marital sexual relations, but they are not graphic. The assassins also work hand in hand with courtesans, which are scantily clad for the era, but not that bad by today's standards.",0
"Assassin's Creed II Is a great game for a mature kid that is over 11 years of age. There is violence, yes, but it isn't to extreme. I'll take this step by step.
Violence: Assassin's Creed II has a fair bit of assassination violence, but it isn't called Unicorn and Teddy Bear's Creed is it? The game has High Profile And Low Profile kills. Low Profile can be as simple as a walk-by stab to a guard or target, and high profile can be like grabbing them and pushing your blade through their guts. There is no gore, only blood (which can be turned off), and it isn't that bad without the blood on. The sword fights and ""sinister"" finishers are all in 3rd Person view (follow cam), so it isn't as if the player is really the one killing the Templars. Assassin's Creed, the original game, had all of the violent takedowns all close up and personal. This game is not, and the gameplay changes depending on your weapon. Note: The targets in this game are all VERY evil. They are called the Templars. These people/soldiers are cruel human beings that seek to control and conquer the land, and rule all people. The Assassins, the good guys, are out to stop them and bring the peace back to Italy in the Renaissance. Civilians are all friendly and if you kill them, you will have a warning or two, and if you kill another, you must restart the mission. The game punishes you for doing the wrong thing.
Theme: It's about revenge. Ezio Auditore Da Firenze is the Italian player character whose family is murdered by the Templars. Initially, he is out to avenge the death of his family, but he slowly realises that he should be a noble savior, not a worthless murderer. He protects what he loves, and fights for freedom. It is truly a good storyline, has some dark bits, but gets better.
Language: There is only about 2 swear words at the start of the game, but the rest are all in Italian, and you can't understand them unless you have subtitle translations on. If you don't have either of them on, then language is no concern.
Sexual Themes: There is a moment of Ezio making out with his girlfriend, then putting out a candle. You do not see anything other than that. There are Courtesans in the game, but no action can be performed on them other than hire them to distract guards. There is nothing too extreme about it.
Drugs: N/A
Overall, play with no subtitles, translations, and blood, and this virtually goes from MA15+ Restricted to M (Australian Ratings, From M17+ to T for teen in America). It isn't all about going around and assassinating people, like in the first AC gaem, but more about a story of love and vengence that gets turned into a quest to stop the evil Templars.
This is great for over 11s, a mature child. It's no where near as bad as Fallout 3, Call of Duty/CoD:Modern Warfare, Dead Rising, Dead Island, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and so on. All of those games have things such as decapitation, sexual themes, and so on. If your kid/teenager plays any of them, then this is fine.
If they have portable games, like AC: Altair's Chronicles or ACII: Discovery, both for DS, the only real difference is blood. You still assassinate people. It should be fine for a mature kid.",0
"The game will teach players both young and old about Italy, the Medieval period etc. The most used swear word would probably be the F-bomb, which is used fairly commonly, although the word is frequently said in ITALIAN not English. The objective of the game is to kill select targets using a huge arsenal of weapons including knives, swords and pistols. Sexual content is not exactly fine for kids and not exactly okay for them either. Parents- look at some other sources about the game then check to see whether you think this content is appropriate.",0
Now this is a great game to play I mean I really love it.,1
What a major surprise to see this being so good and man dora is good.,1
"My daughter LOVES dogs and has seen the Dora Puppy DVD so many times she can quote dialog. This game is wonderful for pre-readers who are just learning to play video games that require reaching goals (i.e. earning tokens to buy the puppy stuff from the store). I like that that my daughter is learning to save token for items that she wants to buy, caring for a pet and addition/subtraction of tokens.
There are parts of the game that my daughter participate in by blowing or talking into the mic (optional, but I haven't told her that) which has been helpful for articulation exercises.
Overall, a great first game.",1
"I'm not sure what other reviewers are thinking, calling this game okay for children (for young teens... really?) I happen to agree wholeheartedly with the main review. Mass Effect 2 has many, many more mature, adult content than it's mild predecessor. Unlike the first Mass Effect, this game gets its ""M"" rating from content that is prevelant in the game - rather than just from one or two scenes. The most noticable and completely unnecessary addition to the second game is a lot more profanity. The first game didn't even come close to this vulgarity (the F word is even used in the second game, though very infrequently). Scattered throughout the dialogue are numorous D, A, H and S words (and to a lesser extent, but still very much there, both B words as well). It's rather jarring, especially in comparison to the first game.
Next on the agenda is the combat. The combat system has been revamped for ME2, making it more ""shooter"" than the first game. This means there is more violence, of course. The violence in this game is more gratuitous than the first one. While blood does collect on the environment in normal combat, it fades away after a time. It also appears in cutscenes or special events (such as scenes when someone is shot and killed next to a window, at which point blood splatters on it - or when you shoot someone in the head, blood will splatter all over the wall behind them) and it sprays from enemies when they are hit. Additionally, some enemies can explodes, throwing red, fleshy bits everywhere (though there are no blood pools around them). Even more, enemies can sometimes be set on fire, at which point they scream and flail before dying.
As a whole, the game seems darker and more harsh. The protagonists aren't all good people and the sides are less clearcut. This can make the characters less attachable or emotionally involving (everyone will have their own opinion on this) and makes the story more dark and mature than the first one.
It's ridiculous to think people would pass off the content in this game as merely mild. This is a game that deserves it's ""Mature"" rating.
Of note (for those that care) is a character that smokes every time he is on screen. Additionally, it is possible to get your character drunk on more than one occasion.",0
"This is one of the greatest video games of all time. The story is fantastic, combat is great, mechanics are wonderful. The final mission was the most intense exciting experience I've ever had with a game. make sure to import a character from the first one for the best experience. There is some blood, and a couple of harsh scenes, especially if you play as a renegade. Language is minimal, the worst offenders being the ocasional Fuck and Shit. You can drink in bars and pass out, but nothing graphic. You can choose to have sexual relationships with other characters, but no real nudity and its all very tame. There are also some areas with strippers, but it isnt that bad either. Overall a fantastic game for everyone to enjoy.",0
"If this game is a movie, I would rated this movie as ""R for strong sequences of sci-fi action violence, mayhem and destruction, suggestive materials/dialogue, language, sexuality/innuendo, excessive drinking, and disturbing images"" Why? Because Collectors is trying to abduct all human to turn into monsters. Secondly, it has tons of inappropriate dialogue including violent reference/sexual comments/and much more. Thirdly, it has huge amount of cursing. Shepard can also unlimitedly drink alcohol at any time with no expectation and without getting trouble...There are some grisly image or disturbing image in the Mass Effect 2 game because Shepard can ""Incinerate"" enemy and then enemy become melted into ashes filled with fire. THat can be scary for younger people. This game is perfect for adult and not good for the kids. Because of adult-like sexual activity, and many suggestive dialogue. I should recommend your child to wait until they are 18 and up.",0
"The sex is toned down showing less skin than ever (still got them blue dancers tho), but violence and profanity has gone up considerably. Shootouts produce a surprising amount of blood that splatters surfaces (red, purple, blue, etc) especially when using ""armor piercing"" ammo which cause massive amounts of blood to splatter surfaces. Some enemies explode into gibs. Cutscenes and environments feature more bloody scenes altho none are grotesquely gory. Burned bodies and blood splattered rooms , including a dead interroagation victim wallowing in his blood and a pile of decomposing humans are seen.
The F word is used. Altho mostly only by 2 characters and not frequently throughout the game (no more than 10).
Story and characters new and old still strong. The plot is less mystery driven and more progression and objective driven but it is well constructed and fun to follow. The choices are more guilt tripping and moving than ever and the combat and resource gathering actually GOOD this time. The side activities are also more varied and involving and personal.",0
"The violence in this game is surprisingly tame for a mature rated title. If you let your kids play games like call of duty, this shouldn't be a big deal. You may have heard about sex in this game, but there is no nudity. Yes, players can have sex with characters in the game but not much is shown, most is implied. There is some profanity but it's not too frequent and your kids probably hear more at school.",0
"I have been a gamer most of my life, and thinking about every game I've ever played, Mass Effect always stands out for me. This series has the deepest characters in any game, and, with the amazing story and interaction, you feel like they are actual people. You feel like these people are your friends, your family, not just some faces. If you betray one, you feel like you stabbed a friend in the back, not just kept a secret from some meaningless character. Everything in this game makes you think about the difference between right and wrong, between friendship and power. You will feel bad for someone suffering because of you. When you couple that with the stress of the war, there are moments where getting the job done feels amazing because you helped those you've grown close to. Yes, the gameplay and story stand up on their own, and yes, there is language, violence, and sexual themes. But all of these things take the backseat to the real as flesh and bone cast. If you let this game in, you will feel for these people. Don't be surprised if, during a particularly tender moment, you feel a tear form. More than one have admitted to it.",0
"Mass Effect 2 is radically different from it's predessesor, an issue that will irritate fans of the original, but only for a short while. In Mass Effect 2, combat becomes more than a simple vehicle to the RPG elements, forcing the player to think out strategies and form a combat style that suits them. The violence has increased somewhat, as blood becomes an issue, specifically while sniping. There is however, only a brief spray of blood that upon closer inspection, disappears after the initial shot, with no blood or gore on the downed target. Now, the real meat of Mass Effect 2 lies in it's RPG elements. Decisions in the previous game, if the player imports their character, have impact in the sequel, some small, and some with galaxy altering effects. The story line is very engaging as you get much greater depth with your allies. I found myself desperately looking for ways to make sure they all survive, and was actually forced to make some extremely difficult choices. Mass Effect 2 also adds an element of actions. Previously, dialogue was the only option for good, evil, or indifferent. Now, certain events will have a moment where you can pull one of the controller triggers to make an action that is either good or evil. This can be anything from stopping a squad member from killing someone, to punching a civilian because of the dialogue they used. There is an issue with language use though, and far more prevelant than in the previous game. Sexual content is kind of a flip flopped thing in this game. It can be avoided, even if the character pursues a romance in the game, as no sex occurs. However, with one particular character, the game presents a big issue. The character wears a strap bra that only just covers her nipples, and in certain dialogue options, the player can choose to have casual sex with her. Both of these can be altered by simply not choosing the dialogue option for sex which is very easy to spot, and by completing a mission that grants a costume change for the character, putting a moddest tank top over the chest. Alcohol and smoking make an appearance in the game, but only the alcohol is of any significance. The character can choose to drink at any bar, however, the consequinces of these actions becomes quickly clear, with a blurry screen and dizzying camera shots to show the character is impaired. The smoking is done by one character only, and the option to smoke is not presented to the player. Gambling makes a small appearance, as well as suggestions of animal fights, but this, like most undesireable elements in the game, is avoidable.
Overall, the game is a fantastic step up from the already sizeable reputation of it's predecessor. The story is engaging, and pulls at the emotions like no other RPG I've ever experienced. The combat is solid, and extremely entertaining and satisfying as you develope a strategy and make it happen. This is a must have for RPG fans.",0
"As long as you're OK with letting your kids play violent video games, then this a good game for them. This game has WAY less violence then Call of Duty or Battlefield due to the fact that you're fighting robots the majority of the time. There is also very limited language and I heard probably less than 10 cuss words in the 30 hour long campaign. Sex is also not an issue unless you choose to flirt with the character which is actually harder to do than you think. There is more violence, language, and sex in most PG-13 movies than in this game. I think its appropriate for teens as long as you're not a ridiculously strict parent.",0
"Like I said in my other review, commonsense thinks all kids are whiny, stereotypical, pick-your-nose, never-grow-up kind of kids. They are not, at least, not all of them. However, this is more violent and suggestive than the first one but only by a fractional amount. Sex isn't something parents should worry about too much, most kids won't go starting relationships with aliens, and the cutscenes can be skipped. The language is more explicit than the last, but if you can turn down the sound, or have headphones that will be just fine. I'm sure my kids have heard worse at school. The violence is still against fictional characters, however, they are nightmarish undead looking creatures that frequently explode, a little gross, I know. Early on, you will go to a club, where fully dressed aliens but in skintight suits will do suggestive motions, but can, and almost definitely will, most kids probably wont even know that you can go watch, and if you do, you just see their back.",0
"So I did something that I haven't seen before in this game, but I tagged this as educational. Why? Because it's a wonderful game in which anyone can examine morality and ethics. (Spoilers to follow.) Is it ethical to hit and intimidate a known criminal to get critical information to stop an innocent young alien from committing a murder? Sure, you can do this, or you can talk it out of him. You aren't forced into either role. The question of moral choice is raised throughout the game, and many choices have real consequences in the game. Any warrior or guardian of society (like modern police, soldiers, and espionage agents) must do or be expected to do terrible things in an effort to maintain order and do what is best for society.
In this way, regardless of whether one chooses to be a ruthless or kind-hearted version of Commander Shepard (or somewhere in between), Shepard is an excellent role model. One can introspect, and ask oneself what they would do in a similar situation. The killing in this game is not often killing of innocents, or killing of people who are simply on the wrong side of a war (as in historical shooters like Call of Duty which reenacts WWII). Violence has real purpose, and many of the people at the wrong end of Shepard's weapons, as it were, are hardly nice, even downright vicious and ruthless (particularly the mercenaries one encounters quite often).
The game also deals with issues that may, in a child's lifetime, be real social issues, like whether or not sentient machines should be treated the same as human beings. Is it okay to just rewrite their programming so that the Geth you once fought become an ally? It raises the question of whether or not it is okay to forcibly impose your own beliefs on others, not just hypothetical synthetic life.
These intriguing choices can serve as talking points to educate children and even yourself about ethics and morality, when violence and war are justified, if they are justified, if the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (a very big part of the recent downloadable content, Arrival).
While the sexual nature of the game should give parents pause, but not undue concern. Sexual themes are treated with a very high level of maturity, much more so in most games and even films. They are good examples of adult relationships that develop over time, the building of trust between two persons (human or alien). They add to the narrative and give the game a sense of realism, not so different from a good novel, and really, one couldn't say that Mass Effect 2 is too much worse than Harry Potter in this regard.
There is much comical and witty humour to be found in the game throughout, the character of ""Joker"" (voiced by Seth Green, who played the character Oz on Buffy: The Vampire Slayer) being one of the best examples.
Mass Effect 2 is a paragon of story-telling and narrative when it comes to video games. It is one of video gaming's most epic tales, deserving of the same praise received by the best literature in history. To deny a young mind the chance to experience this incredible story may indeed be a hindrance in their development.
So, take pause, and consider. It's rated M for a reason, true, but any young person mature enough to be developing their own sense of right and wrong, good and evil, and more difficult moral choices, should easily be mature enough to play this game.",0
"I played this game when it first came out and my son wanted to play. At that time I would not allow it because of the language; now that he is 13 I am considering it.
The sexual content is really overblown with this title. Most of the women are more covered up than other games. Even in a bar scene with ""exotic"" dancers the women are covered up a lot. I agree with others that the suggestive sexual scenes are hard to unlock and when you do they are PG-13 at best.
What I really like about this game is that the player must make good/bad decisions and that affects how he interacts with others later on. You pay for the bad decisions you make.",0
"Absolutely one of the best game franchises of all time. IF you are 18+ and mature minded enough, then buckle up for one of gaming's best.
If you're not 18 or mature, however... and you think playing or watching games rated older than you is fine, and that the ratings people somehow don't know what they're talking about, and that YOU really know what's okay... well, you just proved my point. That's an immature perspective. Obey the M ratings until you're old enough. Sure it unfortunately means you have to skip some cool stuff for now - but trust me kid, you'll be better off. You'll get your turn someday, but you know what... games will be cooler then anyway.
- Tough love from a guy who works in the industry.",0
"I have watched several news things that talked about how there was ""Full nudity and sex in Mass Effect 2"" . I had already played before and couldn&#039;t remember anything with sex and/or nudity. Curious to see if this was true (And if so, I would be very disappointed in the game) and to write an accurate and 'mature' review, I tried to get into a position to even just ask someone. To my amazement (And to some extent relief :) ), I couldn't get it to even get close. I tried going through again normal, and once again, NO SEX. Both times the majority of my team had the loyal thing underneath them. Not getting to that point, I went to youtube to look at some of the cutscenes and they are not all that bad-scene worse on PG-13 movies (There is the Miranda one, which shows her straddling Shepard, but once again, seen worse in PG-13 movies) . You have to start a relationship with that person, and let it grow (As close to real life as game makers have gotten so far), then ask them. So in my opinion the sex aspect of the game has been blown way out of proportions. The game has lost a good crowd due to the ""Oh no Mass Effect 1/2 both have complete nudity and SEX, ""OMG!"" from news reporters and overprotective parents (I have/had two of these :P).
This game has a wonderful AI (Standard Bioware). You can choose certain dialouge that will affect other available dialogue down the road and allow you to do certain actions. Things that you may have thought trivial when you selected a conversation option will come back and haunt you. Characters will become angry and will express this, though im not sure if they go so far as to betray you or leave the group.
As the conversation options and actions are so diverse you can choose to be a &#039;good cop&#039; or &#039;bad cop&#039;. This can lead to bad rolemodels, but I think that is taking things to the extreme.
Overall I think this is a fun game that misses a lot of people because of the sex that doesn&#039;t really exist (Once again, you have to TRY and KNOW and be MATURE to get to the point where the sex becomes a problem-and from what I have seen, the worst is seeing an alien butt for about 2 seconds and the Miranda scene). PG-13 material at worst, seen WAY, WAY more stuff going on in a PG-13 movie. Solid 4/5 game! Mature 14/15 year olds can handle this...",0
I am a dad and my son absolutely loves thus game. I was whatching him play it and it was quite graphic. You are playing as a big robot with a drill for a hand and you just run around and slaughter things. The language isn't too bad. Its not really a sex topic but if you think about it. There are things called big Daddys and littles sisters which just sounds a little odd. Overall I think that if your child is mature and not very squeamish or skiddish they should be fine.,0
bioshock is a fun game but may be violent or scary or bad words but its fun for 13 years and up!,0
"Although there is a wonderful story line, the violence in this game prevents me from putting this as an 'on'. Some parts can be a tad bit frightening thus I'd recommended it for teenagers and older.",0
"Brilliantly made, and highly addictive. Teens and adults will love it.",1
"Both the single player mode and online multiplayer mode are enjoyable and interesting. The only reason I think this game was given the ""M"" rating is because at times it is dark and creepy. The only other thing parents may be concerned with is the violence, but it is nothing over-the-top. There is blood, but no dismemberments. It should be okay for most 13 year olds.",0
The only thing about the game is it uses some profane language but if your child does not speak like this and he knows it's wrong it's not a problem. The strip club doesn't really show anything so it is not a big deal,0
"But you must be a freaking imbecile to think that this is for a kid. You might as well just shoot someone in front of your kid if you let him/her play this. For the adults who like good video games, this is what you want. This game is claimed to be one of the best video games ever made. That should tell you enough.",0
"Great scary action game for older teens and adults.
Intense Violence
Strong Language(f--k,sh-t,c--t)
Drinking/Smoking",0
"Fun Game, just a few problems though....... Language is kinda rough frequent use of F*** and S***. a few posters with suggestively dressed women and there is a Strip Club, nothing happens in the club though.",0
"Decent game but it is very violent, has some curse words here and there, and the player can pick up alcohol and tobacco products. Violence is the largest issue and includes suicide in one of the opening cut-scenes.",0
"We have this game and as adults we love it, but we don't even play it until the children are asleep. Its a very dark game. If nothing else it would give them nightmares. Teens and up only for this game.",0
"Bioshock is a really popular game. But its not for kids. The violence is extreme, With lots of blood and drilling. Not for the faint hearted. Its one of the most violent first person shooters that exist, Its around about the Dead space level, Its too violent for most immature people. Sexual content is only suggestive, and you won't notice much. Language has a certain amount but not severe. Drugs are terrible in this. Lots of injections. Its mature",0
"Heavy Rain is a game about a father in search of his son who was kidnap by the Origami Killer. He has help from his friends but its not an easy task as everyone they meet is a suspect. The story of this game is very good. The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is not too bad. Theres a DLC that's worth getting too. Although good and one of the best game to come out, this game is not for children because this game has a lot of swearing, some sex scene and nudity. Also theres a lot of violent scene and drug use. This game is not intended for children, parental guidance is strictly recommended.",0
"The game is about your choices and the reactions other people have to them. After I played this I let my 13 year old son play and I think it taught him a lot. I think people say games like this are too mature when they are not and I think it’s appropriate for someone above the age of 12. I mean, they know what sex is, and the references are few and far between.",0
"I absolutely love this game. ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) Soo, if you cry easily you might not make it through this game. It's a beautiflly done story about testing how far youll go to save someone you love. It does have quite a lot of death scenes, but gore really isn't present. However, someone is strapped to a table, with a drill about to go into their hoo ha. Nothing is shown but for her beating up the dude :) THre are drugs and alchohol, because your characters with drink every now and then, and one of your characters tales some sort of drug to constantly keep his mind correct, but the drug part is avoidable. There are a lot of scenes with naked people, however, it is mainly them in the shower, but there are some sexual scenes, where Madison ( your character ) is forced to strip down at gun point ( don't worry, she beats the dudes ass ) and how two people have sex, but just legs and naked male top is shown. For the overall maturity, it get's into detail pretty quick. It feels so real when a character dies, or when someone that matters in the game dies, because it goes into detail pretty well. There are cries and screams when your son it hit by a car, and when someone cuts off their finger, they cry pretty loudly. So uhhh yeah its a great game also, check out Detroit Become Human bevause it is made by the same people. Buy this game for your kid if they are mature. A fifth grader might not be able to play this.",0
"I think this game is amazing. It’s a story about how much length a father would go to save his son. There is some sex, good amount of language, and other adult subjects but I don’t think it’s anything someone 15 or older couldn’t handle. The story is a choice game so you get to choose what happens and I think it’s unique and fun to play. It can be emotional and depressing sometimes but the story is great and realistic. There is quite some violence but i don’t think it’s too bad. It teaches people you never know how long you’re going to have someone in your life and the characters are interesting. I would totally recommend this game!",0
"This game is absolutely amazing, great story line. However, if you feel that your child is immature i wouldn't recommend this game. There is bad language, nudity, violence and sex. This seems quite bad however all the nudity can be avoided, you just simply choose not to shower with Ethan and Madison. The sex can be avoided as well simply by not letting two of the characters kiss when given the option. If you want a certain ending you will have to make them kiss, that's all they will do and none of the sex is shown on camera. The violence is pretty much the same as most games now days, but less than games like Call Of Duty. The language really isn't that bad compared to other 15 rated games. This game does have quite a dark storyline but it is a fantastic game so if you feel your child is mature enough to play it, let them. I let my 14 year old daughter play it and she absolutely loved it. It all depends on your childs maturity and how much you trust them not to copy some of the actions. This game does have an overall good message though about seeing how far you would go to save someone you love.",0
"Heavy Rain is an incredibly unique type of game where the actions you take are like options, where you decide to pick which of those options are the best and most wise. The storyline, plot and setting is great and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, including unraveling shocking and unexpected twists throughout. However, this does not mean it's for everyone. Heavy Rain is a very dark, psychological-horror thriller type of game which centers around the actions of the deranged and sadistic Origami Killer, whom tortures and murders young children, and it's your goal to seek justice in stopping his reign of terror and murder. This alone tells you immediately that this game is definitely not for kids and younger teens - best for mature older teens and adults. It contains sequences of strong graphic violence, disturbing and gruesome images, torture, and detailed grisly images of the killers victims. Be aware of the strong (sometimes frequent) profanity involved (uses of the f-word, gd, sh*t) and yes, there are some quite intimate and graphic sexual scenes including nudity in the game, including one character death scene that involves necrophilia. Heavy Rain is an video game meant for adults because of the strong violent content, disturbing imagery, language, sexual themes, nudity and drug usage. At least 17+",0
"Wonderful game, great story and character. It is a pretty hard game if you play it on the hard settings, which i recommend for the experienced player. When played on the easy settings it is a very easy game. Everything about this game is top notch, defiantly a game for the more intellectual player.",1
"In the version I saw, the main characters had their weaknesses, but struggled through them to help others. Ethan Mars goes to extreme lengths to help his son, Madison Page sacrifices a lot to help Ethan, Norman Jayden gives up his drug addiction to help find the killer, and Scott Shelby goes out of his way to protect a prostitute and a cashier who&#039;s being robbed.
It plays out very similar to a movie. there is a dramatic beginning, opening titles, rising action, a definite climax, and then a satisfactory conclusion. The plot is about an attempt to save a young boy&#039;s life and stop a serial killer, so the messages are positive. The content, however, is major red flag for some ages.
Content Summary
(NOTE: all the content below is taken from the walk-through that I watched; thus, there may be more or less, depending on the choices you make)
Drug Content: Moderate-6/10
Norman Jayden is addicted to a fictional drug. He takes two trips, and is tempted to do so other times. We see him experiencing some negative consequences as a result, including hallucinations and blackouts.
Language: Major-7/10
About 50-100 profanities in all. Some uses of f*ck(including a couple combined with ""mother""), as well as sh*t, and other milder language.
Sexual Content: Major-7/10:
Ethan is seen nude in the shower(we see bare buttocks, but no full frontal nudity). Madison is forced to strip down to bra and panties by a thug with a gun. She is also assaulted by several rapists, who briefly paw at her torso(she&#039;s wearing panties and a tank top). She&#039;s also knocked out by a elderly doctor who then slowly runs his hands along her body(his doesn&#039;t last long). Shelby enters a prostitute&#039;s apartment, and she references sex, but this doesn&#039;t go anywhere.
Violence: Extreme-9/10:
Shelby, Madison, and Jayden gets into several brawls, punching and smashing opponents. Ethan also injures himself multiple times(we see violent wounds after a car accident and again later when he crawls over glass). There is one extended shootout, with at least a dozen gunmen taken down. The most disturbing violence includes a boy and a woman(separately)getting drowned. One man shoots another point-blank in the head(execution style). The most graphic moments are when a man is run over by a big truck and we see a blood puddle, as well as when a woman stabs an old man in the heart with a drill(he falls on her, adding to the disturbing quality). Also well worth noting is a scene in which a character has to cut off his finger. He grabs his little finger with pliers, and after a long build-up, slams his fist down on them, crushing and cutting his finger off(the impact is felt, but not shown).
In summary, great game for mature audiences.",0
"Heavy rain mixes both Violence and sex into the game. Much like God of war. But this has a lot of sexual content. Someone forced to strip at gunpoint and topless women. The more the merrier. The violence is a bit high but its no more than you'd see on an average CSI:Miami program. The language isn't too bad at all. Its not that bad, The sex isn't as bad as said but it still lingers.",0
"I love this game. It stole my heart and I believe that it was made solely with me in mind. The game is great but it's not for anyone under 16. There is quite a bit of nudity, a sex scene, heavy laguage and violence, and the setting and themes are too dark for young teens. I think that this an adult only game, but I would let 16 and 17 years olds play too with a little trust.",0
heavy rain is a thriller game that has a dark story line about a serial killer murdering young kids and parents with this type of storyline you know that this game is not for kids this game is only for adults and parents you need to know that heavy rain has a lot of intense violence a lot of sex and nudity shown also characters used constant strong language throughout the game and characters drink and smoke throughout game the story in this game is very disturbing what you are trying to do is trying to find out who the serial killer is that preys on young children and then kills them and you have to solve crime scenes and finding dead children laying dead in the rain trying to find any clues on who the origami killer is.,0
i love this game and believe that parents should have faith and let their kids play this,1
"I can safely say I have never played any other game like this. If you are a person who just plays a game for its gameplay and not its story, then this is not for you. They don't even call it a game. They call it an ""interactive drama"". The game tells the story of tracking down the Origami Killer from the perspective of four different people. I really shouldn't say more because I would spoil it. The gameplay consists of you pressing the buttons on screen and making the motions that the game tells you to. The story can branch off into multiple directions based on what your actions are. One or multiple characters could potentially die and they are gone from the rest of the game. The game does have a few sex scenes and one nude scene of a girl taking a shower. There is some violence in the game like people getting killed and some fist fights.",0
"Napoleon Total War is my favorite game in the Total War series, but it's very complicated and if you are a veteran of Rome or Medival total war like me, it's hard to get used to. On the plus side, it's very educational with good graphics. Aside from the turn based campaign game, players can play historical battles or create their own battles and save the replays.Overall, a fun and informative game.",1
"This particular game is quite educational as you can either expand French hegemony and the principles, ideals and excesses of the Revolution or attempt to defeat the usurper Napoleon. Game players are able to reinstate the Bourbon monarchs with a return to the Old Order or Pre-Revolutionary Europe which was a period of autocracies and monarchical authority or attempt to remove the status quo and disrupt the balance of powers within the concert of Europe.
As Emperor Napoleon I, will you attempt to create a confederation of European states underneath French hegemony and rule as the sole sovereign over Europe or as a member of the Allied Coalition will you attempt to subdue the usurper and despot?",1
Street fighter is back!!! After loving Street fighter IV. I found Super street fighter. Its a great game and is even child friendly. Its just big men kicking each other with no blood or gore. Its got lots of content and characters look comical. This is suitable for 8 or 9 year olds. And yet a hell lot of fun for any age over that. Great game. They have done this pride again!,1
"Yeah, believe it,... Disney. Yeah I know, everyone who would love this game will most likely roll their eyes and spit at the thought of watching some fluff Disney garbage, but it must be just the financial backing of Disney only because as an adult with teens, this is one of the best and original racers out there. With 2 player split screen and the ability to activate various environmental hazards with a button press as well as earnable speed boosting nitro, jumps and lots of Hollywood style over the top destruction. This is a very good arcade style racer with very intense fantasy action. All this is executed with realistic, smooth texture graphics and flawless steering sensitivity with a varity of cars to fit your 'feel' for the road and playstyle. I am usually a very particular and straightforward reviewer, however, being a lifelong gamer myself I can honestly say my second thoughts were washed away very quickly my family all had a blast playing together. Lacking is the 4 player split screen of games like Blur but at the current price of $20 or less it is definitely worth the buy. Besides, after an intense race, taking turns can often be a good thing as you may need a breather in between, which begs me to mention it's fun to watch as well.",1
"Split/Second is a game made by Disney. It's the same company that created Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The game is extremely fast and extremely dangerous if applied in real life. Explosives are detonated left and right with a press of a button. The sounds and the graphics of this game are almost life like, it's a blast. For this game, there is no victory in safe driving. Destruction is the key to winning. Theres helicopters launching explosives on the roads, there are airplane crashes, trucks and cabs exploding. Also theres gasoline stations ignited in fire. This game is full of destructions and explosions. It's a total havoc and chaos just like in most Michael Bay films. But who in their right mind will apply this game to real life? It's a fictional arcade racing game. Young kids who knows how to work any game controllers knows that racing games are not real. By the time theyre old enough to drive, theyll know that driving has rules and regulations to follow. All parents have nothing to worry about. Common sense, video games are not real and should stay behind tv screens.",1
"This game is over graphic. Nudity, sex and tons of violene. Constant swearing! NOT FOR KIDS OF ANY AGE!!! I’m shocked that parents actually feel this is appropriate for younger kids.",0
"Red Dead Redemption is a game set in the Wild West in 1911. You play and John Marston, an former gang member who left and started a family but is forced to track down his old friends and kill them when his family are taken from him. John is a great role model as he realised all his wrong and is now protecting his family. With this expect a lot of gunplay which is about less violent than Call Of Duty. Anyone worried about sex there are some references and one sex scene that can be skipped. It is the first cutscene in mission “The Gates of El Precidio” the scene can be skipped as there is not much story there. This game has frequent language like f*ck and sh*t and a few uses of c*nt. That’s about it. Game overall: Restricted 13 for Violence, Strong Language, Sexual Themes and Sex Scene.",0
"I'll only let him watch me play when I'm riding around, hunting in the wilderness (not when playing the story).
I wouldn't let him play it until he's a teenager based on the language &amp; nudity in the actual game.",0
"It's not gory. Unlike the sequel. It's a bit bloody, but outside the end where the main character SPOILERS dies, there's nothing graphic. And even that Isent too bad. The nudity. Now there is that one naked dude hanging, but it's only in one cutscene, and it A: can be skipped, and B: theat specific cutscene being skipped won't hurt you story wise. There is drinking, bit it's not forced. I'd let a mature 13 year old play it. The 16 up people are probably boomers lol. But in all seriousness, it's a BEAUTIFUL game, with an AMAZING story, and no one should miss out. It's no where NEAR as bad as RDR2. The only really bad thing is swearing, but the swearing ain't as bad as other games like Payday 2. Also, John Marston, while you CAN make him do bad things, in the actual story, he's really trying to be a better man, and just keep his family safe.
Edit: that brief shot of nudity is the first cutscene in the mission “The Gates of El Precidio”. Just have your kid skip it and he'll be fine.
Edit 2: for reference to other games, it's not as bloody as The Outer Worlds, and not as intense as Battlefield V. Bout on par with Payday 2, maybe a little more intense at the end with the death if the main character. There is a short sex Scene seperate from that brief shot of make nudity, but it can be skipped before seeing anything, it's not even that bad. Just make sure your kid skips those two scenes. It really would be a shame to not let anyone 13 or older miss out on this game. Just tell the kid to skip those two parts. You can figure out when the sex scene is coming, and can skip it before anything is shown. Same with the brief shot of male nudity. Just tell your kid what mission to skip the opening cutscenes of. It really is a great game and apart from two skippible scenes, it's really not at all bad.
Edit 3: someone said there was dismembered body's. Nopeity nopeity no..... It says blood and not blood and gore in the rating. Same person said there was drug injection. Nerp. Harshest thing there is is cocaine gum, which is fairly reasonable for the time. Same person said the sex scene had ""full frontal nudity"" and ""vigorous movements"". Haha no. Sex scene, very brief, easily skipped before anything is seen, and there's no vigourus movements. No full frontal either. Just a quick breast shot. If it had realistic sex movements it would say ""Strong Sexual Content"" not ""Sexual Content""",0
"Lots of violence and gore. Usually with guns. But the blood is limited like the swearing and disturbing scenes. Overall, it's an okay game.",0
"Red Dead Redemption is a good video game for adults. It isn't for children or young teens in any way. There is graphic violence, strong language, and drinking/drug use scenes throughout. In free roam, you can kill anybody including graphic killings of animals which is extremely sickening and disturbing to sensitive people.
Why would parents let children under 18 play this?! Yes you can ride your horse around without killing people but parental guidance would be required for that.",0
"Im concerned about what my kids play on xbox and play station and at first i wasnt sure about the game so i bought it to see if its any good and after 7 monthes of playing i realised there were no sex, no drugs the game also teaches about historic events in the wild west and my 2 kids one 11 one 12 got it for there birthday and there were no promblems",1
Nothing inappropriate.,1
"This video game has great adventure,ease of play,and it succeds it CGI,music,and everything! Enough said.",1
"I love the first game, but this game is WAY better! Nothing negative needs to be said about this game! It is truly epic and adventurous! I hope there will be a third game!",1
it is so great and funny and me and my daughter both agree that Yoshi is SSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOO adorable!,1
"If there's one franchise that hasn't changed a bit, it's Mario. The portly plumber has been through alot in the past few years, but even if he's doing the same thing, Nintendo still manages to blow the world away every time. With Super mario Galaxy 2., they've done it again. I don't know about you, but every time a Mario game is released, I get a little happy inside. even if I don't play or buy each and every one, I still feel glad that Nintendo caters to fans of all ages, unlike Microsoft and Sony. There's no contest to which is the better company. While I enjoy the XBOX and Playstation, I really love Nintendo, both their games and their consoles. Buy this game, play it with your kids, and show them a good time.",1
"The system is a Wii.The purpose is to save Princess Peach.The most challenging levels are the Volcano Level and the Sandslide Level. I think that the Volcano Level is hard ecause it has lasers! The Sandslide Level is hard because there is a chicken with bombs.
I like how it has a lot of different adventures. I dislike the game because you have to do like 200 levels and it is really hard to do that.
I recommend this video game because I think this will be a challenge.",1
"This game has been done so many times before it isn't even funny. I have never really been a fan of Mario...not even when I was a kid. I also hate the controls of it on the Wii, which is the lowest quality console of them all. However, I know so many people that love this game. I, and my little sister, never got into it. However, I recognize that its a great game for kids from very young, 5 or 6 even, to older....I had a friend who was till enjoying it at age 17! So really, this is a game that I guess I just will never understand the appeal of.",1
"You probably will get bored of this after beating the entire thing if your an adult, if your a kid though, then they will play it more crazily then me when I had Super Mario 64. I never got farther then 101 stars.",1
My son beat it in under two weeks of receiving it from his Grandma and Grandpa as a birthday present. He did not sit around playing all day; nor did he play each of the 11 days it took him to prevail. This seemed to be the perfect amount of time to challenge him without overly irritating him and he still has enough interest in the game to play it all over again! He did get a little angry with me when I wouldn't let him play when he wanted...a bit of addiction did result from play of this game. -mn,1
kinda scary for kids.,0
"Nintendo you rock i mean man another five star game getting my GOTY already for 2010 SMG 2.
Thank you Nintendo the Wii is the best system ever!.",1
"My little ones can't seem to put this one down. In the past week, driving by a baseball diamond, they yelled ""Begya Baseba! Begya Baseba!""... haha. Although the price was cheap enough, I've had to buy two new baseball gloves for them because of this game. Better than another video game, I guess :)",1
"This is a good site for kids.... but you have to buy a club penguin card, in order to get them outfits! My Kid has to get a game card!? Yes... its true! This is what i hate about it!!! But i suggestion is that you should not buy stuff on the internet! Its Dangurous.. they may even still your credit card change or money!!! But, No way i am buying this for my 8 year old!!! She can play some other game! (Talking About Online Club Penguin, Not For DS Or Dsi).",1
"I had this as a kid and it was incredibly hard. I had the Nintendo ds version so it might be a bit different from Xbox or ps4 but generally I know that it's going to be the same. Couldn't get past the first level. I remember learning that tons of other kids could not finish Lego Harry Potter. I found this recently and gave it to my little brother. He is way more of a 'gamer' than me and skilled with fast reflexes. He hated it and couldn't do it. Yah, it's a Lego game, you think it is for little kids, right? Wrong, Lego games may be less scary than video games for an older audience, but lego games are damn hard. I also had lego avengers and only got two levels in before getting utterly stuck. This game might frustrate your Harry Potter loving kids and hurt their confidence. There is nothing inappropriate abput this game, but it is unnecessarily difficult and not a high quality game.",1
i have this game on xbox 360 it must be backwards compatible on xbox one i had it when i was little i gotten the platinum hits edition of this game when i was in first or second grade so this was the best game to play even when a kid wanted to play this game best for all ages so i gave my friend the lego harry potter collection to him for the ps4,1
"If you enjoy the Harry Potter mythology, this is a very enjoyable game. It's more appropriate than the movies are for young readers. Lots of puzzles to play and areas to explore. The story line is close to actual book/movie plot line. The game is very intuitive and has a the same solid control mechanic as all the previous Lego games. This one is much better than Lego Star Wars.",1
"We have discussion with our child about how when you ""blow up"" a Lego toy the can be put back together but real people can't. It isn't very violent and we play with our son as a family in 20 ish minute blocks (1 board). He really enjoys it. We are pretty conservative about what we let him (violence, language etc) so he won't read the books or see the movies for a good 3 or so years yet. It is a nice intro into a series that we enjoy.",1
"If you're cool with the whole Harry Potter mythology, this is a very enjoyable game. Story line is pretty close to actual book/movie plot line. Lots of puzzles to play and areas to explore. The game overall is very intuitive and it's easy to figure out how to operate controls. Much better than Lego Star Wars which seems like one non-stop battle. I only wish they would have the option to make primary controls switch after every quest is completed so more than one child could take active lead in the game. Lots of arguments of which way to go because on person is always in control of the game play.",1
"This is my personal favorite of all the Lego video games due to there being more puzzles and problem solving and less combat. As a fan of the books and movies I was very impressed with the consistency of the scenes and storyline.
My son started playing this at age 4 and found the almost constant aiming (pointing at objects with the controller) pretty difficult, but that just gave me an excuse to play with him.
I found a few times while sandboxing in Hogwarts that I couldn't go back to complete something if I missed it the first time through. This is frustrating, but I don't think it's a bug, I think it's meant to require more in depth strategizing.
Replay capability is excellent.
Really enjoyable game",1
Anyone who likes the Harry Potter series is going to LOVE this game! I couldn't put it down and I finished the game within 4 days. Your kids will absolutely love Lego HP!,1
"It is a great game. I love it. It is easy. I am 9 and I beat it in 6 days. I have no concerns.
Approved by Nick's mom. :)",1
"We got this on the release date, being huge Harry Potter fans from the books to the movies to the games. My kids (7, 11, 14) LOVED it from the first moment! I love the humor in the lego games, and I love the theme of good vs. evil in Harry Potter in general.",1
i love this game! its so much fun kids ages 6-11 could enjoy doing rtg because of the customization of your player.,1
"Very dark but also poetic experience. However, there are lots of VERY gruesome death scenes of the main protagonist, and the overall atmosphere is very scary and creepy, some jump-scares also, so totally not suited for children. I played it through when we didn't have children yet, and it was fine then. But now that we have, I just can't anymore. It's too dark even for me now. Recommended for grown-up noir horror fans.",0
"This game is clearly violent yes, But its just a black figure getting decapitated in no detail at all. I see worse violence in Littlebigplanet for god's sake. Its not really bad at all even though the decapitation etc makes it violent. As i've said in past reviews. Its like a kids game compared to some PS3 games I've played.",0
"I don't know if some of the reviewer actually played the game but it's gore af: even if it's in black and white, there is decapitation, hanged corpses, spider that litterally pierce you, giant saw... So there is a lot of blood. But the atmosphere is unique and poetic in a way",0
"The most beautiful game I have seen. And it scares the pants off me. I quit because it was too scary. It is grayscale and shadowy spooky, with things that jump out at you and chop your head off. It isn't gory, because it is in grayscale. But I wasn't enjoying it. I don't like horror movies and what not because I don't like when things jump out at me. But the artistry is amazing. I can't speak to the puzzles because I quit too early. Not sure I could lure children to their deaths... if that is indeed a challenge / puzzle.",0
"This is one of the most depressing games I've ever played. Sure it's challenging, atmospheric, etc. However I wouldn't exactly say it's fun. The game tells a story without dialogue or narrative. The world is cruel, oppressive, aggressive, and you will eventually die no matter how much you struggle. Do not give this game to anyone who is suicidal.",0
It's a really bad game and very graphic. A young boy gets decapitated and limbs fall off. Should be rated M.,0
"I have played a bit of this game the first thing i thought was T for teen and it only has 2 citations from esrb how bad can it be. While the game is challenging their is many deaths that are not lego type of deaths from this game like drowning, crushed, impaled, traps that kill the player in gruesome way or attacked by other ones like your main character you play. The creep factor is spiders and other things in this gameAlthough as far as i see from the game their isn't any blood in the game(maybe due to the black and white ground) this game is where it stands. If your son/daughter likes scary stuff and knows this stuff is a bit wrong with parent guidance and then i would recommend this game to children of 11 years old players 10 or below might be scared and scarred for things that go on in this game.Since their is only two buttons and directional pad i feel like this would be easy to use but not to play as this game requires some level of thinking to solve. The concept of the premise of this game will be confusing to younger children.",0
Contains: No blood at all. A fantasy character in a black and white world. Spike traps and giants vicious spiders. This game is Intensely Scary! IT WILL DEFINITELY SCARE CHILDREN UNDER 10+,0
"I loved the game. It is an amazing piece of art, but my 7 year old daughter saw me playing it and got spooked. She said that it was the dark environment and the hidden and unknown dangers what she didn't like. She asked me to turn it off. We both jumped when we got attacked by the first spider :).
She didn't get scared when the boy died, it was the unknown and creepy factor what affected her.",0
"This is an amazing visual game great for people who love plat-formers, but i do not recommend it to anyone 14 and under due to the graphic deaths scene that the player must go through.
It is a game meant for adults and older teens 15 and up not for you 10 year old looking for a fun game to run around in",0
My daughter loves these games and they are very safe. She could be doing a lot worse and they are educational. You can't get much better than Nancy Drew.,1
"My 10 year old daughter farms on her iTouch and occassionally Facebook applications. This held my son's interest (11 years) momentarily (as in one week) and while totally appropriate, not what his age wants to do.",1
"This is the latest (and last) Halo release. The game is a prequel to all other Halo games, and leaves off where the original Halo begins. This game is the best Halo game to date, and is fairly mild in regards to violence as compared with Halo 3. Yes, you are still shooting aliens for the majority of the game. However, the moments of actual violence against humans is fairly sparse and infrequent. The game developers could have added more gore and blood, but it seems they made an effort to tone those elements down in this title and focus on the story and gameplay. There are moments when human teammates get stabbed with alien energy swords, but there is no blood or gore shown in those moments. The ESRB gives this game a M rating 17+. This is for blood and violence, but like I said, those moments are fairly rare and the game is toned down compared to other titles such as MW2, Gears of War 2, and certainly most other first person shooters out there. The reason I rate this game iffy for for age 11 is that there is violence and occasional intense moments of action. The violence is mainly alien in nature. The role models in the game display great heroism in the face of danger and can be a launching point in discussing bravery and sacrifice in the name of a bigger cause. The story is well thought out, and the visuals are amazing. There is multiplayer available online for this title and if offers the coolest feature I've seen yet. You can customize your multiplayer experience and add filters for content like language and skill level. For example, you can choose to display lobbies that are categorize the tone as polite. Also, they have a filter for more competitive play or playing for fun. This is a really cool feature Bungie introduced with this title and I hope it does well and other game developers catch on. This way, at least I have a better chance at finding a lobby that isn't cursing at each other and trash talking all the time. All being said, this is the best Halo title to date and if your kid is interested, be sure he/she can handle alien violence and be prepared for a discussion on bravery and courage in the line of duty.",0
"I am a 8 year old using my mom's account. Halo : Reach is a great add on of Halo : Combat Evolved. Parents should know it is very heavy on the language--using B*****d, B***h, and Hell. The game is also very heavy on the violence including dead citizens, bodies, blood, and much gun fire. Sometimes enemies will yell for help and run away and one scene has a girl who just lost her dad. The game is very easy to play and use. That is just my opinion of the game. This type of game seems to have a control formula. There are many positive role models because friends/ teammates heroically die for the greater good and sacrifice themselves for others.",0
"Voilence
As you walk through the game there is a lot of dead corpses that have been brutally killed. They have body parts removed and there are a lot of blood trails
Before you jump out of the plane Carter (noble 1) is driving you see blood all over the window and see carter with a very beat up and bloody face. This could upset younger players
Grunts die very gruesomely in warfare even though they have blue blood. They can be shot in half. There are also suicide grunts that run at you with two armed grenades hoping to blow themselves and you up in the process
Explosions, crashes, fire, buildings being destroyed etc
Some aliens have red blood but when you shoot them a medium amount comes out. Also both aliens and humans leave pools of blood when shot and killed.
Most of the game is filled with basic gun violence from assault rifles to rocket launchers. Both aliens and humans will bleed when getting shoot, aliens do not have red blood. The amount of blood is more than the previously Halo games.
When you are not using firearms, you are either using a turret, or in a spaceship, or shuttle.
In the level New Exodus the city has been invaded by ""The covenant"" civil people are lying dead all around the city, killed by the aliens. The mission is quite suspenseful.
The game also offers the player to attack aliens with a knife, however the enemy must not be looking at you, making it a pretty rare occasion.
You can stumble upon some civilians or soldiers with an injury or wound.
The brutes are much larger than the player and aliens, and can be intimidating to younger players.
In space battles if you die, there is an explosion, and the pilot perishes. This may disturb some younger players.
Language
Some marines can use the f word on some occasions. if your are looking for it you will probably find 1 per mission
Bitch is frequently used
Constant uses of damn and hell in missions
some uses of goddamn
uses of profanity throughout the game, such as (hell, damn, crap, s**t, bastard).
Online players may use foul language. It is recommended to disable online chat for younger players.
If the the game was a movie it would be rated R for pervasive strong violence, disturbing and bloody images, brief strong language, and strong thematic material",0
"I am 9 years old. My mom hates shooter games and she doesn't let me play Mature rated games, but this is the one exception. I play online with one of my best friends, and he skips all of the violent/graphic scenes in it such as someone getting shot in the temple by needlepoint. There is language in one scene of the whole entire game, but it is very mild. As you can see, I suggest Halo: Reach for the more mature 9 year olds. It is also very easy to play. The controls are simple.",0
"Violence: ••••• (5/5) Violence throughout, characters are shot, stabbed, and killed, viciously and sometimes even brutally, some blood of both human and alien, a human character's head gets cut off, multiple human characters die as well as multiple alien characters, a human character commits suicide.
Language: ••• (3/5)..., One use of f--k, multiple but infrequent uses of s--t, b---h, butt, hell, crap, damn, bastard, God, and freaking.
Sex: • (1/5)..., Mild sexual references/innuendo, a holographic female character is naked and somewhat visible, a male and female human character(s) kiss passionately.
Drugs: X (0/5)..., None.",0
"This game is fun! I assume that all of the NBA video games are fun, since they are all basically the same. But in this game, you can play as Michael Jordan in the 1990's Chicago Bulls team and play against other teams from the 90's! That is pretty swag!",1
"In an earlier review of Fable II, I wrote that I thought it was odd the game was rated not for kids. The ""adult"" sorts of things in that game were presented in a manner that was thoughtful and a great way to engage teens in all kinds of discussions.
This game doesn't really have that value: it is as though a group of drunken frat boys took over Fable II and changed all the choices from two thoughtful ones to sophomoric or more sophomoric. For instance, in Fable II you can have (offscreen) sex with a character, and you face the consequences both physically (pregnancy or STDs) and emotionally (partners can become attached to you and are hurt if you ignore them.) In Fable III, prostitutes encourage you to have a three-way. In Fable II, you amuse crowds with a goofy Cossak-style dance - in Fable III, you grab the person you're interacting with and pull them into a lampoon of Dirty Dancing. In Fable II, while there's fighting, it's fairly asceptic - in Fable III, enemies die in a blood explosion.
The changes in the style of the game were unneccessary and diminish its value; instead of it being a journey of self-exploration and discovery, it's just a typical slash-and-bash.
I will say, the voice work is absolutely excellent in all the Fable games, which is refreshing.",0
"Good game for mature tweens. Some of the cutcenes in this game are inapropriate but they CAN be skipped. This game is a great way to learn to take responsibility by keeping your kingdom in order and keeping criminals in prison, adopting orphans, breaking up fights, saving peoples lives from bandits, etc. But you can be evil and avoid good decisions.",0
"I would rate this game 14+ because it has a pretty good amount of sex. You cannot have sex whenever u want which is a good thing. You have to get married before u have sex. They don't completely show it but you know they are having sex. They also use the word w**** it the game witch is disturbing. But you can stay away from all that stuff! The violence is not bad at all, it's cruel at some points. There is a fair amount of blood though.
I hopes this review helped.",0
"As far as Fable III is involed you start out choosing whether your character is male or female. You play a character who tries to overthrow his/her evil brother from the thrown. Throughout the game you have the opportunity to make moral choices,which can be overwhelming depending on the player (Such as choosing whether to pardon your brother or behead him). There is a vast amount of violence, where you see characters killed and can kill character yourself which would lower your morality rating. Cussing and drinking is prevelent within this game, your character can get drunk and inevitably vomit in the game. Sexual content is an issue, since your character is capable of sleeping with numerous partners as well as being able to cheat on any current spouses your character may have in the game. Other than that the character does portray somewhat of a positive role model, when they inevitably remove the evil brother and your character runs the kingdome responsibly.",0
"I allowed my Mom to buy this game as a Birthday gift for my now 12 year old son based on reviews and ratings from this website. My main concern now that we're experiencing the game is I cant figure out how to disable sexual content as touted on this website and others. I have done several internet searches and browsed the game menus but no luck. I am aware that my son can choose to not partake in such adventures but some of the quests sound harmless but then ask you to ""seduce"" someone out of the blue as part of the quest. Had I not been there to explain what that word meant he wouldn't have known what he was about to embark upon. Anyways, just a word of caution for parents who think they'll be able to throw a switch to off and walk away.",0
"This game is not as bad as Common Sense Media makes it out to be. The violence is not very bad at all, just a tiny bit of blood. Cursing does come up a bit, but not too excessive. The main problem is the sexual themes. If you charm people enough, you will be able to have sex with them no matter the gender, but nothing is shown, only sound effects. Overall, not as bad a a lot of other games, but not for little kids.",0
"I dont know why this game is rated Not for Kids The violence is definitely not as extreme as many first-person shooters that teenagers play (Halo, Call of Duty) and sexual content is optional. Any curse words are no different from what a teenager will hear in any high school. The only thing that parents need to decide is if your child is mature enough for the option of the sexual content. The screen is blocked out when the character engages is sexual intercourse, and again, nothing is said that any teenager wouldnt already know. The game teaches that actions have consequences, and I am happy for my 13 year old to play it.",0
I love this game my mom likes me playing this. If your good in the game there is nothing bad.,1
"As an adult, it's my favorite game. But for a child I wouldn't recommend it unless they have a clear sense of what's acceptable in real-life. It's entertaining, and your character also has moral choices. They also learn that if they are evil, people will act accordingly (i.e. Booing at you, makes it more expensive to buy things) and being a good moral person will make people like you and give you store discounts.",0
"I am impressed by the discussion questions generated by the decisions the main character makes throughout this game. I believe they create avenues for critical thinking and moral reasonng. I think some of the sexual content in the game can be used for an avenue for discussion as well (e.g. most children around the eigth grade age are learning in health classes that unsafe sexual practices can result in STDs). My biggest concern with the game is some of the violent scenes, and the ability to be evil and kill innocent villagers. I see that as extremely innapropriate for any age. I belive this is a good game for parents to play with their older children and young adolescents. This game can present learning oppertunities, but isn't the best game for unsupervised play, especially online.",0
"I think this is an excellent game, and with a mature enough child a good parent child game for navigating moral choices. The strength of the game is it provides reinforcing messages for making the ""right"" choice, but it is also its downfall. I would not let my child play this in my absence.
Depending on where you fall in the moral spectrum for exposing children to content around right/wrong decision making I would caution the game starts early into ""no right answer"" dillemas where the character has to choose between two evils. I have not seen any graphic outcomes from this, but the concept could be enough to turn many adults (and parents) off. An early example is when the character has to choose between ordering execution of a friend or a group of strangers falsely accused of treason by the games nemesis (a tyrant). Character is not offered option of refusing, so a choice is forced. This plot device forms underpinnning to the story, but is the biggest example of age inappropriate content in the game for me. Again, nothing graphic (you don't see events unfold after decision), but I thnk concept is the problem in this case, and bright kids get concepts even if they don't get meaning.",0
"While I am a fan of morality tales and clear cut good v. evil, Fable III has content that is just not appropriate for this age group. The Fable video games have tried to put the player's actions at the forefront of the game. Everyday choices, like how you interact with others, affect your moral standing. You basically have a good v. evil bar that measures your decisions and adjusts accordingly. This can be quite fun. There are very silly ways of being evil (like kicking chickens), or more serious ways (like murdering others and stealing). Many decisions in Fable III are catch 22s - that is, someone is going to die no matter what decision you make. Fable III also has lots of implied sexual content. In fact, the game keeps track of how many sexual partners you have had, and even STDs that you have caught. Now, you are not forced into any of these situations, but the option is there if you would like to pursue those avenues. You can marry, have kids, and start a life together. The family aspect may appeal to some, especially if you are a sims fan. But, I do not appreciate that the designers included achievements based on having multiple sexual partners, STDs, and other forms of fornication. The violence in Fable III includes many blood splatters and the occasional beheading in combat. Also, if you use the shock spell and the fire spell(yes, there is magic. It is a fairy tale type setting.) enemies become skeletons lying on the ground. Some cussing can be overheard and suggestive comments from some characters is noticeable. If your child plays online, he/she has the option of interacting with other players online. As you can see, there are many options for your child to meet other people, get married (or not), and engage in various behaviors. This is why I think online safety is an issue in this game. The story is well crafted, and it is a lot of fun to eventually become King and rule Albion. However, because of the serious content I think Fable III is best left in older hands who can handle the adult content presented in the game.",0
Highly entertaining and occupying for the whole family. . . .,1
"I would rate this 18+ unless you changed the gore and swearing in the settings, then I'll recommend it for 13-15 year-olds.
Being a war game, there is a lot of violence to be expected. In the campaign there's constant shootings and blood gushing, and if you shoot someone to the head, you'll see bits of brain matter with access blood gushing out. Sometimes with certain high power guns, you could blow off a limbs ""only in the campaign and zombie mode."" You can also shoot civilians, though if you shot to much, you'll have to restart the section of the mission again! also there is constant swearing, the F word was said around 50 times throughout the campaign missions. The campaign mode is the most brutal part of the game, but the most goriest would have to go the zombies. As you try to fend for yourself againsts countless of zombies, you can blow their heads,arms,legs off with a high powered weapon. You could even blow half of their bodies off with a grenade! If you make it to a certain level, you will have to fight off zombie dogs ""hell hounds."" Which is very instance and scary! The multiplayer is less brutal. There's no decapitated arms or legs. Just access blood when fighting. THE GOOD thing though in
this game is that there is no nudity or sex scenes or strong drug abuse.",0
"This is a great, well-made game, but I would only recommend it to only teens and adults. When you sign in to the game, asks you if you want to turn on the graphic content or if you want it off, which makes it okay for older teens, but the enabled graphic content is for adults only with gallons of blood, explosions, and dead bodies everywhere. I would not recommend it to younger teens or below because of the mere fact that it is a first-person shooter game. The way the first-person nature is portrayed in this game is much more graphic than in games like the “Halo” series, since there are parts when you actually get to see the entirety of your character. You almost never do in these “Call of Duty” games. The guns and ammunition are more sophisticated and this is why the target audience is older teens and adults.",0
Great graphics great story great protagonist it is a game that will have everything you want it is incredible,1
"Similar to World at Wars violence. Dark tone and murky morality retirn as well. Constant violence with frequent dismemberment and tons of blood. No decapitations though. Viscious scripted moments include a man having eye gouged out (partially off cam but we see blood spurt), a man has glass bit in his mouth and is punched leaving his mouth very bloody. A man repeatedly bludgeoned in head witb lead pipe (extremely gruesome skull cracks and we see brain matter). Some veitcong have throats brutally eviscerated (player motions are very savage). A mans face decays away as hes exposed to toxic gas. Slow mo bullet to head (bloody), a pick ax to back of soldier forming a blood volcano. Gory bodies in laboratory.
Not as fun as previous entries. Campaign decent but overly grim and has pace issues. MP maps uninspired and feels clunkier and slower than MW2.",0
"THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY FUN! I am 18 years old, and I LOVE Nintendo! There are some mild violence throughout the game, but it's all silly and cartoonish. Parents, your kids will definitely love this game! It has great characters, bright colors, awesome graphics, and cool moves! If you parents like Donkey Kong as well, you will surely be impressed with this game!",1
"My first ever review.
This video game is about an ape named Donkey Kong who found a crystal coconut and became ruler of Kongo Bongo Island. He has a best friend known as his sidekick, Diddy Kong. Along with his other friends, Cranky Kong, Candy Kong, Dixie Kong (which is Diddy Kong's girlfriend), and Funky Kong. But, there's evilafoot that wants to take his hands on the crystal coconut, The Dreaded King of Rool, along with his henchmen, like General Klump, his general, his very goofy bodyguard, Krusha, and a lot more. Donkey Kong protects the crystal coconut from The Dreaded King of Rool to keep Kongo Bongo safe and sound. So, this is a decent spin off of the other video game they released before this one. I'm going to give shows or anything else like these grades below:
A - Outstanding
B - Good
C - Okay
D - Poor
E - Bad
F - Terrible
So, this show will get an A. I will also talk about the voice acting, animation, graphics, dialouge, sound, educational value (if it's educational), and lasting appeals and give them grades and scores too. Here are the results:
Voice acting: A 5/5 Great voice acting, although it could use some fine tuning.
Animation: C 3/5 Some people said about the 3D computer animation was bad, the animation in my opinion is decent.
Dialouge: A 5/5 They are funny dialouges in some scenes and sometimes a lot of scenes are goofy at times, but sometimes they say stupid things like Krusha usually says.
Graphics: A 4/5 The characters kind of look a little funny, but the backgrounds are decently designed, they should make the graphics better when they make a sequel to this video game.
Sound: B+ 4/5 Tropical hawaiian music with military music. It could get obnoxious watching it with people who don't like it.
Lasting appeal: A+ 5/5 The series can be loads of fun to watch, so you can just knock yourself out with this video game.
Overall: A 4/5 This is a decent spin off of the video games that I mentioned before. If you are a nintendo fan, this will probably be a decent show for you to watch. And also, I am a huge nintendo fan of course, so have fun watching this!",1
"I wish I could give this game a million stars, because it's so great. I, being a long time fan of the DKC series, couldn't wait for this to come out. it was very exciting seeing how far the series has come. It's an excellent single and multiplayer platformer with enough replay value to make it an excellent buy. Must Have.",1
"Gran Turismo 5 is undoubtedly the best one out to date, because of it's new high definition graphics, realistic design and settings, and the new array of high octane performance vehicles to choose from. Consumerism is one of the biggest concerns, because all the vehicles come from legit brands that are seen around the world. Also, the concept of the cars receiving damage and sustaining car crashes is NOT like how the cars are in real life, because in Gran Turismo 5, cars only receive minor to moderate damage such as scratches and dents, even in cataclysmic situations, and the drivers come out completely unharmed. From the basic knowledge of myself, everyone, even children, should understand that if someone drove a car in REAL LIFE and sustained that much damage and turbulence - they will die from the injuries and explosions inflicted. So, this game may not be a good choice for the younger crowd because they might get the wrong impression displayed by the game play. If they completely understand both fictional and non-fictional concepts, then they should be fine.",1
"Nothing at all bad.Clean, no speaking, no crash damage, no exlosions, its a perfect driving game for your child and you. But no Music!",1
I think this is a great game... but I don't know about the bad camera angles. I just played this in store to test it (there was a set up thing to test.) and nothing went wrong with the camera angles. The game is quite fun so don't miss out on this fun (slightly addicting) adventure.,1
It is very gory with intense violence if you like scary horror games with a lot of Gore and blood and violence you're going to like this game there's one part of the game where if you press the wrong button your eye gets poked in and it's not off screen. They move the camera in close so you can see all the Gory details if you faint because of blood and gore and violence don't play this game. Then at the beginning I'm not going a necromoph sticks its long claw to the back of someone and it can be really scary. So if you don't like blood and gore or eye pokes or intense violence don't play this game.,0
"One of the most goriest games in the world extremely scary and has lots of gore.
Extreme Violence
Strong Language(f--k,f--ker,sh-t,bullsh-t)
Lots of Gore",0
Occasionally corpse alien women who show 99% of a woman's bare breasts. There are frequently cartoon swimsuit magazines depicting very scantily clad top half of a woman in the game. Towards the end there is a hologram woman in a very form fitting suit that appears wherever you go.,0
I think 12 years old is the minimum age as long as the 12 year old is VERY MATURE. I mean VERY MATURE. If your 12 year old can handle the violence and the startling scares it should be okay. There is not a whole ton of profanity. I think a better age would be 13-14 and up but a mature 12 year old like my own can handle it. He has all 3 games and he is fine.,0
"Dead Space 2 is an extremely gory and frightening first person shooter about Issac (main character) that ventures through a dark and eerie spaceship where you see people graphically transform into grotesque and disturbing creatures that resemble parasitic demonic aliens that lunge out at you unexpectedly and kill you if you're not paying enough attention. Also, Issac sees very horrifying images of his deceased girlfriend and the gruesome fatalities the enemies inflict on you (decapitation, disemboweled, dismemberment, cannibalism, stabbed, sliced in half) all shown close on screen. If you're the squeamish type who doesn't like horror and extreme gore, DO NOT get this game.",0
"While this game can be innapropriate on the language and gore, all that matters is how well you know and trust your kid. if you trust him enough to not use that language then I don't see a big deal, But if your kid says words they don't understand or accedently uses bad language then maybe hold back a year or two, this includes if they get scared easily or not . As long as you trust them it' not going to be a problem and they'll be happy.",0
"MAIN REASONS!

"Hey guys, its me again. Today im gonna talk to you about Dead Space 2. This little dandy is fun, but also intensely violent (possibly the most violent game ever). Parents must also keep in mind that this game is meant to scare. Various unpleasant beasties will burst out of vents when you get too close, which while not too scary per se, can give you gray hairs when you arent expecting it. Others will play dead, and few things will increase your blood pressure like walking past a ""dead"" monster, and it leaping up with a gurgling screech and attempting to tear out your throat. Each and every monster in the game is disturbing in its own special way, from melting you with acidic vomit to turning you into one of them. Perhaps the most graphic violence in the games happens when the player is grabbed by monsters. Many monsters will grab the player, attempting to kill them. The player is prompted to mash a certain button to escape from the monster's grasp. If the player wins, they overpower the beast and kill them in an awesome (though gory) fashion. If, however, the player fails to fend off the creature, it will kill the player with a kill animation of its own. These are invariably gory, and usually involve decapitation or dismemberment. As for the monsters themselves, they are very grotesque, as they take over human corpses and alter them to fit their needs. This could mean 3-foot scythe-like blades on their arms, bio-explosives wired to explode upon death, or long bladed tentacles used to decapitate the player. Though made from human bodies, the alien life forms are often unrecognizable as human. As for language, it is fairly intense, though seldom heard. so be aware of that. There is no sex or nudity that i am aware of, though i have only beaten the game once and havent done any of the optional stuff.",0
"I loved this game, and I know other adults and teens will too! Its very violent and gruesome, but makes for an excellent guilty pleasure.",0
"this game is amazing first off the graphics, story line and multiplayer are awesome. But of course its rated M because its a horror game of course there's gonna be blood and gore when you shoot the necromorphs, what did you expect confetti to come out of there bodies? The language isn't that big of a deal either because 90% of he game your by yourself not talking to anyone, and when you do get to someone they either die, try to kill you, or tell you to go do something to help the escape all together the dialogue in the game is little. Some parents are just over reactive with their children thinking their to young. I personally have the game and played through the game twice and outside the game it doesn't scare me, i don't look behind my back every 10 seconds just to make sure nobodies trying to kill me.",0
"Out of all the video games I've ever seen, this is the most deserving of the rating ""M."" The language is an issue, and the violence and action will literally make you want to kill everything that moves at any loud, sudden noise after a few hours of play. I play this game on the computer with my son (going on 13.) We both have experienced the thought I just mentioned, and believe me, it isn't good. My son and I learned to limit our play time, and then it became one of our favorite after school games. He likes to look up the way the ""necromorphs"" act, what kind of people are used to create them. (sick people make ""pukers"" pregnant people make ""pregnants"" and your average Joe becomes a ""slasher"" just to name a few.) He looks up strategies to kill them, and grasps the whole ""strategic dismemberment"" concept. I am a little worried about how easily he tears the zombies apart, but he's not experiencing any symptoms of prolonged play that I haven't felt myself, and i find the necromorphs very interesting. Swearing is a huge problem, but ask yourself, if you were alone on a space ship where the entire crew has become zombies, would you swear a lot as well? My son hasn't used any language in front of me, so I'm not too worried.
Aside from the violence and swearing, the game is very emotional. My son and I get tense while walking through a dark hallway, scream when something jumps out, get mad as we get betrayed, use problem solving skills and intuitive thinking to get past malfunctioning machinery, and get teary eyed alongside isaac as he awaits his death. We've fallen in love with main characters isaac clarke and Ellie langsford, who display good teamwork and heroism. The bottom line is this game is fine if you limit your playtime.",0
"Allow me to explain my little bubbles of insight. Or whatever they are.
Educational: Kids are taught the dangers of the world, and why they should stay inside with mommy and daddy dearest. Unless they know all of the back story...in which mommy and daddy dearest are Unitologists...
Positive Messages: Isaac is trying to escape and live. Living is good. Surviving is good. You people are so stuck on the gore you miss the rest of it.
Role Models: Well, there's only a few characters in the game. Isacc, the hero. The bloodthirsty necromorphs trying to murder everyone. And the a-hole humans trying to control the necromorphs. Give you a clue, one is a role model, the other is a nightmare, and the third is a metaphor to human meddling
Violence: Keyword here is excessive. You think it's dead, you rough it up a bit, just to make sure. Better than it coming back after you. And stabbing? What game was the reviewer playing? I wish you could stab, but you can't.
Sex: I gotta laugh at this one. Sex, seriously? Maybe if Nicole wasn't dead. (That's Isaac's girlfriend...killed in game 1)
Language: Ok, what would you say if a twelve foot monster impales the guy you were just talking to, throws him to the ground, and starts coming after you? Dearie me?
Product Placement: Every Dead Space piece of purchasable merchandise can be found! The plasma cutter, the space suit, they even have places to buy things! Those corporate scumbags!!!
Drugs: Last time I checked, a medpack isn't a drug. Just like a band-aid
Safety: Actually, kind of. I played this game, and later that night I didn't feel super safe.",0
"This game, while fairly violent, is not really all that bad. You can shoot the limbs off necromorphs, the monsters in the game, but they hardly even look like humans anymore. The cursing only comes up when the main character talks with someone else, which really doesn't come up that much. Overall, this game is ok for some 12-year-olds, and if they played any other game where you fight zombie-like monsters, this will not be much different.",0
"I have to admit dead space 2 is as gory as hell, if you like that sort of thing, you are going to LOVE this game. However, this game is NOT to be played by Kids and teens. Expect copious amounts of gore, language and scares! The atmosphere is so tense, it makes resident evil look like Scooby doo. Also there is the multiplayer, this is one of the best multiplayer games since MW2. The fact you can decapitate other people online is highly amusing and invigorating. All in all this is one of the best (goriest) games of the decade, up high with the likes of mass effect 2, MW2 and halo reach.",0
This is the most violent and gory game i have ever played it is all around messed up there is like 50 different ways for isacc clark to die all including insane amounts of blood and gore i played a part where guy a goes crazy and slits his throat resulting in blood all over the window next to him,0
"I love the game but its very bloody, very scary,and uses a lot of mature language.",0
"Although it is great, it is not a kids game. It has lots of violence, blood, gore, and langauge all displayed in an over the top, distubing enviornment.",0
"Lots of blood, and decapitations, but infrequent. Mostly, you are having visions, very scary noises and exploration.",0
"Dragon age Origins was my favorite of the two but this game was fun. I would be careful with a kid playing this one tho, The first game was pretty mature and this one more mature than the first. It can be scarey, bloody, violent, You get either a sword (Great sword or Daggers) or a mage staff and you kill enemy's with those weapons and results can be left bloody. Sexual subjects are in the game to like ""Romancing someone"". In the first game there was a button that could skip but i tried using it in this one and it did not work and then the screen went black. and homosexual romance's, yes. I romanced Fenris the elf and I had a pirate woman named Isabella flirting with me and trying to get me in bed. And this blood mage kills your mother and turns her undead which was shockingly disturbing. DA2 is a really good game but cautions please it might be great for me but maybe not for your kid",0
A great game but I wouldn't let anyone under 15 play it.,0
"When I played the demo, I instantly realised how violent it was, first kill I got chopped someone in half. Then decapitating, dismembering and EVERYTHING. Bit of sexual content, but a bit of a worry still. Its not too bad if you are mature, but expect a bit of cringing.",0
"This game has too many profanities it has blasphemies and way too many times do they use the name of Our Lord (1 is too many already) but this game it is filled with it.
There is a sacrilegious element (which there is no option to skip it nor go around it) such as you fight in the ground of an empty Episcopalian Church in New York. (I am a Christian Roman Catholic I do not believe that attacking or using any church to attack is justifiable even in cases of war. it is completely Unnecessary for a place that is dedicated to God.) There isn't a profanity filter option if you want a profanity editor you may download it from a website called Gamesoap (http://gamesoap.net), However even so this does not remove the sacrilegious element nor removes blood/gore. Do not let your kids trick you nor some reviewers of this site.
One of the characters in the beginning of the game commits suicide as he points himself the gun. The game it is too violent when you encounter already dead bodies in the beginning (later on this review I will explain further of very important information.) the stabbing in game looks very realistic.
There is no sexual content as far as I know, nor suggestive However as for nudity there is one part, I originally did not noticed it at first when I played it, however in the very beginning of the game after you pass the dead bodies in the cells there is a place where you click the computer to be able to hear a message between a female and a scientist, most players missed it since they do not show the face nor anything else except as you turn to look at the room The left side of the room you see a dead body covered with medical blanket as the ones that surgeons have in a hospital operation room, the only part uncovered is a teared up chest (it is very gory) of a women (how I can tell the dead body's chest is of a women sicne it is teared? you might ask.) I will not give more description of what is on the sides of the blood in chest (with that being said it is more than enough).
This game is not definitely for children nor adults! It is an insult to God to play this game due to blasphemies and the sacrilege in addition to the unnecessary described content.
There are other games that you and your children can play this one is to skip.",0
"This game is very good for pre-teens,
it has a good role model, in this case prophet (main characters name). Prophet is trying to defend his city from terrorists and aliens.
also the game has excellent graphics and should be played by children.
most parents would not like the SOUND of the game BUT its just a video game and theres no real harm in playing it.
one last thing to all the worried parents out there worrying about there children going of and be cereal killers or drug dealers... relax, its a great game and theres nothing to be worryed about.",1
"this game has a really good storyline, with diffent choices creating moral diffenrences later on in the game. the actual game play is depicted with minimal violence and out of this world graphics while the use of profanity is few and far between. an amazing hit especially if you want your child to be able to play a game like this without the blood and gore. AMAZING.",1
"A great shooter all around, no matter if you're a story or multi gamer.",1
"I love this game! But there are some concerns about it. First, the violence is a little much. As you are wounded blood splatters on your screen. Also, enemies splatter blood when shot. The violence is just above Halo Reach, and not near Call of Duty, or other military FPS of todays time. The language is not so bad, but F**k is said about 6 times throughout the game. Overall, the game has some frequent blood, and infrequent but harsh language, though nothing too extreme. The game is amazing!",0
"The Message is positive, the man is protecting his home. It's pretty easy to play, and the protagonist is a great role model for kids to become loyal and patriotic.",1
"This is a fantastic visual feast, the graphics are suberb, the combat is sublime and the fun is over the top. However There is the matter of the violence and language in this game. There is lots of bad language in this game, such as f--k's and s-it's. Though players usually fight alone so you don't hear it so much. There is loads of shooting, punching and jumping in this game and blood is shown, but not frequent. There is such things as turning on armour mode and punching the jelly out of aliens, jumping and smashing to the ground, blowing everything around you in another direction and the most violent aspect: stealth assassinations. Stealth assassinations are were you turn stealth mode on, walk up behind someone and knifing them. This is roughly the same assassinations as halo reach, but not as violent.",0
Safe for most kids 10+. Great story. By far the best version ever released here in the US.,1
"I bought to play with my son as he loves pirates and does well with the Xbox. I knew puzzles would be tough for him, but he can figure out most. I don't let him play alone, though, because there are some slightly frightening parts and difficult parts. We have a lot of fun playing it together and he loves unlocking all the different characters. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the cut scenes are pretty hard to follow. I still have no real clue what happened on the 4th movie (haven't seen it) despite playing through those levels.",1
"The game play is challenging enough to keep the player's interest, but not so much that it becomes frustrating or confusing. The signature Lego humor is fun, but the cut-scenes make very little sense. My kids (10 &amp; 6) hadn't seen the movies, but greatly enjoyed playing the game, even without understanding the storyline.
Anyone paying attention to the reviews AND the age recommendations will notice that I flagged this game as ""on"" for ages 8 &amp; up, yet mentioned that one of my kids playing this is 6. I believe my 6 yo would've had a difficult time playing the game on her own, without the guidance of her big brother.
The only complaint I have is the game occasionally freezes up, forcing me to shut down the PS3 console. I haven't run into this issue with any of the other Lego titles we've played, but we don't have the most recent titles other than P.O.T.C.",1
one of the best lego games.,1
Our children need education to be fun....Here it is..,1
"My son is addicted to this game on pbskidsgo.org's website. It's hard to find something nonviolent that will catch his interest, but he is hooked on this game. It features planning ahead, defeating a villian, a woman boss (Mother B), working to earn money, budgeting, and finding treasures - a great combination of educational value and adventure. Top notch! A child must be a good reader or work with a parent to play.",1
"Just like the first, not that violent or gory. Sure the monsters can be a little gross but it’s not too bad.",1
"Surprisingly good game, not too violent as well. Even then blood is easily turned off.",1
"Going into this I thought that it would be a grotesque samurai game, it was the exact opposite. Nothing really pointed out to me as violent. My son enjoyed it and it didn’t seem to change him at all.",1
"Same violence as the 1st (which is rated 15 on this site). Its very fierce and bloody; but also stylized and fantastical, reducing its impact compared to something more gritty and brutal like Bloodborne or Sekiro.",0
"This is a game collection of the original Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and Bioshock infinite. It also include's the Bioshock 2 DLC Minerva's den, and the Bioshock Infinite DLC Burial at sea. And these games might be very cool, but they are not for kids. These games have a lot of violence, have a lot of swearing, has both sexual and drug references. You can drink alcohol and get drunk as a result. A couple of kids in the game smoke cigarettes. And the social/political backdrop of one fictional city, set in the year 1912, has the use of derogatory ethnic/racial terms. So all in all, I think that this game is amazing but shouldn't be played by kids under the age of 18.",0
"This game is definitely an 18 and might not be appropriate for viewing at work, here are my reasons: Extreme Violence, Blood and Gore, Racism, Infrequent strong language, mild sex references and general intensity. Warning: This game could easily scar a kid for LIFE!",0
"My 15 year old son plays this game, at first I was extremely confused about the point story and the unrealistic blood but I definitely don't think it is as bad as current games. This game is a remastered version of the original 3 bioshock titles just with better frame rate and graphics according to my son. It's storyline is basically just a dystopian society in which your character is aware of and must try to make aware to the people, unfortunately the way this is prevailed is by killing the communist leaders. Bottom line is you let your kid play games such as common call of duty games, for honor, watch dogs 2 or GTA 5 it should be a step down in terms of maturity and gore due to the older technology that it was originally made from.",0
"I played the first one when I was 4 and holy moses I loved, then I played the 2nd and 3rd one, eventually I heard these gruesome ass games were remastered in a collection. Re-doing the graphics made these phenomenal games better. (Note:The first one is known as one of the top 10 games ever made by several critics)",0
"Bio shock is a incredible game, but the violence it portrays may be more for kids on the older side because some of the bloody images might be scary for younger kids. Although it is very unrealistic violence and a kid over 9 should understand that. In my opinion this game should be rated.",0
"My 10 year old boy loves this game. But, he also has been playing AOE 1 &amp; 2 &amp; Age of Mythology for a few years so the transition was not difficult.
If a child has never played a strategy type game before, you might want to explore whether they liek it or not.
While the graphics are incredible, my 10 year old says there are not as many historical characters in this game as he would have liked (i'm not sure). In Age of Mythology he learned mythological characters names and roles. In AOE 1 &amp; 2, he learned some of the historical figures (he loves history). In AOE3 he hasn't run across many characters besides a slight mention of George Washington, etc. But he still loves the game and the graphics are amazing. He usaully looks up cheats on the web and tries those. Liek running over colonials with Monter Trucks and such. Incredibly addictive for kids who like history and/or war type themes.",1
"AOE III is certaintly not for everybody. Parents should know that it is a game all about building up a civilization to crush another one. The only way to win is genocide. However, the violence isn't the kind of thing that I believe would alter someone's view on war in a violent way.
You should make sure that your child can handle the large explosions and mass deaths. However, if your child wants this game, chances are they are LOOKING for a challenging but fun RTS game. They'll be ready.
I believe that any Tween is mature for this game and quite possibly those in the single digits.",0
"My seven year old and 14 year old were having so much fun playing this game, until one day they came across some rather rough language. At a certain point, the robot companion, Beep-0, utters the word ""Heck"". Now, I cannot have this within my household, because it is teaching my seven year old vocabulary he does not need. So my seven year old is no longer allowed to play this game, or, for that matter, watch his brother. Please be careful around this game, parents of younger children. I should also note that this game has a mild amount of cartoon violence.",0
"Well...there are many things i can say about this game, but if you want both your kids senity and their well being, do not let your kids play this game. It infuriating and is not for kids that this game is supposedly ""design"" for. There are many areas of the game macanics where it is simply unfair on the player. It is not enjoyable to play, nor is it entretaining. I love stratagy games, HOWEVER, this game is just simple garbage with great graphics.",0
"Technobabylon is a throwback to point and click adventures of old. Gameplay here is minimal but fairly clever and the story has well written characters and dialogue, as well as a convincing ambiance and good but subtle music. Altho the villian motivations could have been more fleshed out and aspects of dangers of net addiction and all seeing technology could have been explored with more depth, and puzzles leave some to be desired. However as a whole TB is a good 4 hour ride that holds your attention with its interesting themes and makes you have hope a sequel can look even deeper into this world. Granted like many video games the sequel hook is quite shameless but welcome here.
As for the content. It is very mature yet not gratuitous. The pixel art is surprisingly realistic and the writting makes them feel even more human. There are violent scenes such as a man falling to his death with bloody and even bony results. A gruesome crime seen with a bedroom with dismembered body parts and a bloody body in a hot tub. We later see the deaths happen in a flashback including a bloody shot to the head and a disembowelment (while the act itself is off screen we see blood and organs plop to the floor as it happens). Other violent scenes include a bombing that leaves charred and bloody corspes, gruesome mutilated naked bodies hanging from meat hooks at an ""Exotic"" resturaunt (while pixelly in design, genitalia and posteriors are vaguely recognizable), a decapitated body with blood on and around it, a bloody engineer crushed by an elevator, mooks shot with bloody results and tamer violence involving tasing wet enemies, a simulation/ recreation of a nuclear event from the game worlds history, a strangulation and a character about to freeze to death. There are also relatively tame sexual references such as one to a ""sexbot"" and addicts doing degrading acts to gain entry to a club. There is also a level that requires the player to buy narcotics to drug another character and another where a character sees horrifying visions under the affects of a hallucinogen. Language is mild with uses of Damn, @$$ (some times with ""hole""), SOB, and really silly sounding use of ""Nuke"" in place of obvious intended F words (Get nuked, nuke yourself, ah nuke it).",0
SO SCARY!! its fun but too scary for under 13!,0
"It is very, VERY scary... NOT FOR KIDS. But for teens and adults, ABSOLUTELY!!! A MUST PLAY, BEST IN FRANCHISE!!!!",0
Its fine it is a horror genre Other parents has said “TO SCARY17+” but if you get it then you know what your getting into But don’t let kids under 13 see the tape messenges they reveal some dark things but other than that kids 8- will be scared by dark rooms and night terrors switch is a good version for kids but older than 12 then VR is fine,0
"It’s a good game overall with a lot of good scares but the backstory is gruesome and very horrific, as long as you don’t let your child learn about the back story you’ll be fine!",0
Some concepts such as Jeremy cutting his face off with a guillotine paper cutter and a malicious bunny who has a mind melding murder history is pretty terrifying and none of the less if you are a fan of the franchise this game is highly recommended!,0
Its really fun and it's rated T for a reason guys. If your to scared to play it thats fine but your reaction isn't the same as everyone else. I see 10 year olds playing this game and having a good time.,1
In this game it is a game made about the death of 5 kids and there murderer.,0
"Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted is a game collection of the first 3 FNAF games re-imagined with some other short games included as well. 'Help Wanted' was created as a virtual reality game so the immersion experience is more realistic than the mobile or computer games. Fans of the franchise will enjoy this new take on the classic survival thriller games that have seen tremendous popularity in the last six years. The FNAF games aren't for young kids and a lot of children are being introduced to these games by their older siblings or classmates. There's quite a bit of lore behind who the animatronics are, who owned the pizzeria, etc. that is too intense for younger audiences. The third game features a very disturbing animatronic character if you know the backstory of this character. FNAF is mostly a psychological scare game and doesn't rely on blood/gore with its horror. That's why it's more tame and why parents tend to go easy on it and I understand that. But the story surrounding it makes it too much for kids. FNAF fans will like this game, it's an excellent remake. 5/5",0
This is a bad game don’t play it it will give your child nightmares. It has too many jump scares and can very much scare you. DONT PLAY IT!!!,0
Omg SO FUN!!!! but so scary!I am a serious gamer and i think its probably for early teens so if you are younger than 8 EXTREME SCARINESS!,0
"This is my favorite Animal Crossing game. Even with the new Switch game I’m still managing my position of mayor in game. It’s one of my favorite games on the 3DS and my favorite in the franchise. I lost my original copy so I bought a “new” copy at Walmart about a week prior to the Switch game that came out (I got my replacement on March 14 and the Switch game came out on the 20th). I have already put nearly 50 hours on this file and I have only put in a sad 4 and a half hours on the Switch game. I love this game and for those who can’t afford a Switch and $50 at Walmart for New Horizons, this game is a great entry point at $20 (plus $130 for a New 2DS XL to play it). I will probably never need another Animal Crossing game with this. It’s not as pretty as the Switch game but it still has good graphics and the island is the best way to get bells because you can get rare fish and bugs.",1
a super cute game with animals but you need to read so 6 and up!,1
It shows that life isn't always how you want it to be. Kids should know that while he/she is growing up. Especially at ages 9+.,1
My title said it all. Very fun game. Very tactical.,1
"Hello i am a young adult who has actually played this game and wants to give an honest review that can really help the parents. First of all DO NOT BUY IT FOR YOU KIDS, the game is very good for adults it is an intense and exciting thriller. Might be fun and interesting for adults, but then again for kids you have to do things like: Dig a key from dead policeman's rotting corpse with your bare hands! YOU HAVE TO kill a possessed man with a CHAINSAW in a very brutal manner... remember the policeman i just mentioned? you also get to see how he's head it split in half with a shovel in front of you... And those are just few examples of graphic human violence/gore among with the plenty of rotten flesh laying around in cellars etc. The whole story is about humans being possessed by strange virus making them go insane, so its not meant for kids AT ALL! You should not be proud if your 12 year old plays this, on the contrary its a very bad thing! my parents didn't care for the age restrictions, but maybe you can be more sensible and at least consider it if a young man who is used to this kind of stuff says that this game IS VERY VIOLENT AND GORY. Its ridiculous how God of War (PS4) gets same rating as this, as god of war is completely geared towards children when compared to this. I'm a young adult man who likes this game, and who's spouse likes this game - but we certainly DO NOT recommend it to anyone below age of 16 ( and 16 really is the extreme minimum here)
THE FINAL WARNING: Being exposed to this kind of games at too young age might carry a psychological damage that shows only later in life, as it involves realistically simulated violence. People here saying its ok for kids either A) are trolling you B) are the kids themselves who want the game C) have no idea in general about the game.",0
"Based on the other reviews, I am clearly the only one who played it through completely.
The story revolves around Ethan receiving news about his deceased wife he sets off to find her before being trapped within the baker manor. Sounds like a great time except for all the contains graphic scenes, including multiple on screen suicides, limbs being mutilated off, multiple decapitations, murdering a loved one, screwdriver bring driven through the hand, and a women giving birth to insects.",0
"One of the best story mode games I've ever played, but it's as violent as a video game is gonna get. Very bloody and gory and scary disturbing images. Not for kids at all. Also lots of language, mostly the f word.",0
I think these game is very good of playing i liked very much but think also that you can check if your child is not scared,1
"I was happy to see commonsense media gave this a five out of five; with the direction of somewhat new, yet old style material from previous games in the franchise, Resident Evil VII feels completely fresh! From the characters, the storyline, the atmosphere, and even the tone of the game, you are automatically hooked in from beginning to end. I ended up playing this on the VR and it gave me a terrifying experience; having things up in my face to even just seeing the environment around me was amazing and chilling. Note that it might make you feel a little sick from playing on it so I didn't play with the VR headset the whole time. The demos that featured different characters in the tapes you find also have a big deal in the story as well, which I thought was cool on Resident Evil's part. This game is well worth the wait and sure know how to put ""survival"" in survival horror!",0
"I got this game for my 11 year old son and I dont have rules about swearing or sex or violence in my home so im aware of how much cussing is in this game. (sorry about my grammar im tryna write fast) anyways heres a review if you do have rules. 1: This game says the F and S word and other cuss words left and right. You can here your character swear in fearfulness or anger. 2: Sex. This game has no sex refrences really (your objective is to rescue your wife) but anyways in the early game your getting chased by a guy named jack and then he has a chance of saying (Ethan ima squish you hehe hope marguiette didnt hear that.” Marguiette is jacks wife. I probably didnt spell her name right. One part during the game you find your wife behind a cell then jacks son takes your wife and says “daddy right, mind if i borrow mommy for a little bit?” 3: violence. This game has gore and violence and blood. 4: role models. You play as a person going to save his wife. during your search you find a strange family and they all wanna kill you. You find weapons and kill the what used to be a human family throughout the game. You killed many people basically but near the end you find 2 of the family members as normal humans then you dont attack them, then one of the family members tells you how they got infected and went crazy. Then he tells you to free his family by stopping the source. You accept this challenge to save the family then start to head to the source to stop it. So you didn’t have a choice but to start harming the family when they were infected. So Ethan (the guy you play as) is a good man because he saved the family and if you choose he saves his wife that tried murdering him because his wife was infected.",0
A little bit too much violence great storyline but it can be gruesome at parts age 14 and up seems suitable,0
"I honestly don't undestand low age rating parents/kids reviews because this is not only the scariest game, but the most frightening cultural experience i've ever had, so much more than any scary movie. Besides, I really like this genre and consider it the best title of the series.",0
"Resident Evil 7 Biohazard is an Excellent horror game. It’s definitely top quality and managed to pack in some excellent scares and moved away from the action a bit and focused on the puzzles and horror. Here’s what parents TRULY need to know:
Violence: the game’s violence is very gruesome but not necessarily graphic it’s definitely violent and disturbing but it’s portrayed in a manner that is not entirely realistic for example you are fighting superhumans made of mold and yes it’s very disturbing and scary to see a man burn to death and then come back and watch his bubbling, bloody skin shift back into place but it’s supernatural and loses some impact because this could never actually happen. The violence that is the character is inflicting is not on actual humans and is entirely in self defense and the violence that is inflicted upon the character is not to distinguishable but in rare instances it is pretty brutal for example having you’re hand sliced off with a chainsaw. Now this sounds pretty bad but (minor spoiler alert) the character himself becomes resilient due to supernatural reasons. In general you’ll hack and slash mold creatures with knives and fire handguns and shotguns at these monsters and watch pieces of there body fly off, you’ll see blood on the characters vision when attacked like any mildly violent video game. Some especially disturbing sequences involve Jack burning and coming back a corpse, slowly regenerating his tissue and skin.
Fear: the game is actually surprisingly tame in fear levels but still manages to freak the player out. There are plenty of jumpscares from the juman like characters and the monsters which will definitely scare some people but only in the moment. What might affect younger children fear-wise is the design of the enemies, mold monsters are pretty scary (similar to the demogorgon in stranger things) and the human like characters are even worse, Jack’s mangled like appearance is quite haunting and will scare younger children below the age of 13. If you’re kid has seen some horror movies than they should be ok.
Swearing: Parents have to stop worrying about swearing, if you’re kid is old enough to want to play this game I have no doubt they hear foul language constantly in school and choose to not use it until they are old enough to use it in appropriate scenarios or just decide to use it. There’s not much to do about it. If you really want to know bad language is frequent in the game but hear me out, The ANTAGONISTS use swear words such as the F-word, S-word, B-Word, D-word etc. (no racial swears) to insult the player, now I think this is a very good thing because the players HATE the antagonists so they will also HATE there manarisms, including using swear words to insult. Now the PROTAGONIST does curse very rarely when injured which is fair because studies show that a human can withstand pain for longer when cursing.
Drug use: you see some needles in the toilet and the protagonist can used some focus drugs but this is not really a common theme and again it’s mostly the antagonists who are IMPLIED to use drugs and again the player doesn’t want to be like the antagonist
Suggestive themes: there’s nothing really relating to this area
Role models/messages:Ethan is determined to rescue his girlfriend and is resilient no matter what happens and doesn’t give up, the bad guys are implied to take drugs, swear frequently and inflict violence on others
Consumerism: there are several add on experiences which add more story elements which I have not tried out. This is nothing like free multiplayer games which constantly try to manipulate children into purchasing skins and cosmetics for there character
Educational value: there are some great puzzles that require problem solving skills and it teaches teens to be wary of strangers
Conclusion: resident evil 7 is an excellent experience and takes a different route from previous games in the series. Violence is gruesome and typical but also has a heavy supernatural element which makes it less graphic, swearing as insults is portrayed as bad and the game has a healthy does of fear. I would really recommend this to anyone who enjoys FPS or survival/horror and Seriously anyone over the age of 13 might be a little bit shocked but they will definitely be able to handle this unless they are veryy sensitive or sheltered.
My goal is to give truthful reviews and bring justice to extremely overprotected or joke reviews so kids can enjoy media without being harmed but also not being overprotected",0
I think that the resident evil games have all been violent but it is kind of the plot of the story and you just go around shooting monsters that have mutated but there is a lot of gore hence the ESRB rating but I think it is fine if you or your child has seen pg thirteen movies. There is some language but not much. I think if you are used to this it will not be that bad so it is a very good game so I would say for kids 12 and up for the cartoonish gore but realistic graphics.,0

"Resident Evil 7 Biohazard is the most recent Resident Evil game and could be an end to the franchise.You play as Ethan, a man whose wife goes missing, to the Baker family residence.You have to find little things like keys and coins to unlock doors, weapons, etc. You can't avoid killing the Bakers, but you can make decisions about how you attack the Bakers. In order you kill Jack Baker, Marge Baker then last Joe Baker. You find dead bodies, disected body parts and alien things that you have to kill",0
"It is a nice game, with good game play.
You as hero are set in a world infested with dark demons it's up to you to figure out what happened. It's a well balanced gameplay between battle and puzzle. The mobs you encounter are not for faint hartedh that's why I give it 18+ rating.",0
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a masterpiece. Beautiful visuals, outstanding story, the combat is quite challenging, even in the late-game, but you can customise it to suit your style.
There are certain outfits that may be considered inappropriate, but these are entirely optional, and can easily be avoided.",1
This game is really good but has very realistic crashes but no people. That is why I rate it 8+ You should definetly play this game,1
"Probably the best ""open world"" racing game. Very smooth graphics on PS3. While some people may complain about billboard advertizements in the game, I feel this is an acceptable way for publishers to generate revenue and helps keep the price of games down. It's done in most movies now as well. In the real world, we don't put blindfolds on kids every time we take them for a drive so that they won't see billboards.",1
"This is a great fantasy racing game with a few bad messages. This is very child friendly. It shows you how not to drive! Burnout has always been cool and fun but this is the best for kids, Not hard. You can either compete in races or drive round at 200mph. The best way to see Paradise city is at 250mph. Its got bad messages because of you drive horribly. Trying to blow yourself up. Well I do and everyone else. Its very kid friendly overall. Its fun!",1
"This game is great, plain and simple. No language, no alcohol or drugs and nothing big to worry about. Although, parents should let their kids know that this is not the way to drive. Even though some of the driving action in the can be imitated, it's not really an issue. I would recommend this game for teen players.",1
This is a cool car game with crashing and racing. i,1
"And it sure doesn't dissappoint. More vehicle crashing mahem, more racing, and more DESTRUCTION. Appropriate for all ages, but especially anyone 10 or over. VERY FUN!!!",0
"what a great game this turned out to play.
wii you done it again!.",1
It's a great active game for the whole family.,1
"Our Family loves this game! My 8 year old got it for her 7th birthday. It is so easy to ply that my then 5year old played too. It gets everyone up and active. It reminds me of the old Power Pad from the original Nintendo, I loved that as a kid and my kids love this. There are many differnt games to play and tons that you can unlock the more you play.",1
We all love this game. Easy for the youngest to learn how to play but challenging to perfect- fun for the whole family!,1
"Great game to get kids (and mums!) up off the couch in the dead of winter. My son and I had fun playing together, but he found it too difficult (5 years old) to play on his own.",1
"I have a 9 year old boy, who is usually bored because we don't have kids in the neighborhood to play, and i just had twins so i can barely take him out to activities or to the park. This game is awsome, i even play with him at times but everytime he does it, he loves this game and my is also loosing weight, he is overweight so this game is surely helping him loose few pounds.
I am really glad i got this game, now the whole family enjoys this game",1
We got this game for Christmas. A great active game for the whole family. My 4 year old will choose this over her princess games if you can believe that! This game can be a workout but also has fun teamwork games. Buy it!,1
"My 4-1/2 year old got this for Christmas. The whole family enjoys playing. If she has a hard time with one event, we take turns or team up to help each other. Great exercise for everyone!",1
"Hello, I am a father of 3 and wanted you to know everything to know when thinking about purchasing this for your child or in my case, when your child wishes to purchase this game and to allow him or her to do so. First thing to note this is a game I knew little about when my son asked me if he could purchase it. Traditionally I do not allow him to play 18's games or for you Americans mature, so at first I said no. He told me to research it and give it a chance so I thought it was fair, so I agreed. When I first began researching, many said that it was bloody, gory, violent and contained both intercourse and nudity and bad language. Again my feelings stayed the same but with more research I discovered that the sex scenes could be disabled (most sex scenes in the game are also optional. There are at most three that are mandatory but there as described can be disabled. These scenes also never show any genitalia and at most only show topless women). The said ""blood and gore"" wasn't half as bad as was described in many reviews. I began to feel that my son was right and I began considering it but wasn't fully convinced, yet. I began to watch game play and saw that this blood and gore wasn't at all the main focus of the players attention but to consider when to dodge and time a well placed strong attack. This shedded some light on the complex combat system and the timing needed to defeat your opponents in combat and wasn't the same old brain numbing button mashing seen in some of my son's older previous games and instead required thought and strategy. The only gore i could really find was the odd underwhelming dismemberment of limbs that when happened, flew out of view onto the ground in less then a second or two (the limbs where also not very gory as from watching, they usually turned black when cut off and did not show a lot of blood when cut taking away from the gore that you may have imagined). The blood is also nothing to be concerned about. In fact I've seen much worse blood in a 15's movie or even some 12's movies. The so called ""sex scenes"" where mostly off-screen and at most showed nudity of upper chest area, essentially saying the level of nudity found in most 15's movies. Please note that those scenes can be fully disabled or can be skipped when happening. The language was least of my concerns because I knew my son had heard worse in school. The odd f**k or s**t and the worst being c**t which didn't appear often. The one thing that I found which really swayed me was the views and the topics explored in the world. War was a very common topic explored. Going through burn't down villages and hearing the odd woman cry. It really opens one's eyes to what its like and doesn't glorify it at all. It shows war as a destructive act that sacrifices for most, everything. A huge topic it explores frequently is racism and sexism. It is displayed even in the smallest ways, for example in a village you go to very early on, you get attacked by thugs who hate you because your a witcher (the job the main character plays as). When you ride your horse through the village you'll hear the common words. ""We don't want you hear!"". It also expresses racism and sexism in other ways such as social class and even a person you meet who was homosexual and was out-cast from the village. The world isn't something you can just hop in and out but it is surprisingly realistic (besides the creatures and magic of course). All in all this wasn't just another violent, mind numbing game but a learning experience. Something I didn't get out of any other game me or my son have played. Overall if your child can handle the odd bit of blood and language, I would highly recommend that you allow your child to purchase this game or purchase it for them, to be able to experience this incredibly made game while diving into worth while topics for your child to explore and question and to make morale choices with the incredible created main character, Geralt of Rivia (who actually is a good guy, helping people who have trouble with awful bandits or monsters who terrorize them. Also the only humans you kill in the game would be these awful bandits). If you are concerned this is a medieval fantasy Grand Theft Auto, it is far from it. In fact you actually help citizens and are unable to hurt or attack them as the game does not allow you to do so.
Quick note: This game is also amazing in quality with 251 awards received also considered one of the best open world RPG games of this generation. It has over 200 hours of content with amazing side quests which are extremely memorable compared to other games in this genre. The game has a beautiful thriving world with probably one of the most memorable casts I can say in the history of open world RPG games.
Thank you for taking the time out for reading this and I hope I have put the game in a better and more clear light for you concerned parents.

"Focus not on violence, instead it promotes peaceful solutions and defusing situations",1
"Good game
My kids love it and I think everyone should be able to experience this fantastic game! It has gore filters in case you are offended by those types of things",1
"I’ve had four children, and as a fellow parent let me tell you that these reviews are often exaggerated from what the game actually is. Although the game does have both partial nudity and some gory violence, it’s nothing most teens haven’t seen before, and parents tend to grossly underestimate how much their child can handle. Of course, it’s up to you on whether you think your child can handle it, but I would advise you give them a chance, and it will make them feel as if you trust them. Ultimately though, it depends on the child. My firstborn was incredibly sensitive to blood and gore, so they didn’t play this until they were 15. Another one of my children is incredibly mature however, and is able to easily play extraordinarily violent and frightening games, because he is easily able to separate them from reality. So I let him play it at 14.
To conclude, it really depends on your child. But I would suggest that you give them chance to enjoy this amazing game, and trust them to know their own limits. Your relationship with them will be all the better because of it, for you will both feel respected and trusted.",0
"My partner bought this game but I (mom) ended up getting really into it. My 10 yo daughter played a long and really enjoyed it too. There’s totally immersive quests, engrossing story lines, exploration, strategy games (gwent cards) within and complex character development you have to build to gain ability to meet increasing difficulty.
I personally don’t love the barbie doll template for female characters, although the main two female characters are extremely powerful. It was definitely designed by/for nerdy boys with raging hormones and a reductionist view of ideal body type.
Also a lot of condescending references to women - there are prostitutes in the game and endless deriding labels and references.
That said these issues are not the focal point of the game. It’s won many awards for a good reason. If you like D&amp;D style action, fantasy and adventure- this game is incredible!!!
My partner and I we’re up late playing and we triggered an, ahem, romantic scene. It was a straight up sex scene! The character Kiera climaxes with stereotypical arched bag and huge cartoon boobs in full glory. So NOT for kids!!!
Personally I’d hate to loose cut scenes...will look into disabling sex scenes so my daughter can continue adventures on another profile.",0
"The game has took up countless hours and hours of my life, from mission to mission. The story is unbelievable yet there are scenes of swear and repetitive violence, either slaying a dragons in the woods or hunting giant wild beast. There are over 200+ hours of fantastic game play here. During the cut-scenes though, (which can be disabled, as I did for my daughter) were moments of sex and drugs. These only appeared once or twice, and at MAX showed women with no tops. For most of it, its just another bar with prostitutes walking around which the game itself only shows glimpses of the girls when they are actually naked. For boys or girls 14 or older, the game is fine. The amount of inappropriate content compared to the running around the vast landscape, in search bandit hideouts or animals is such a small ratio that it is almost not part of the game. Especially the wild hunt is a kid version of GTA V, it includes the same extraordinary world and story, yet no shooting and killing cops, and MUCH less drug reference and nudity. amazing game would recommend it to anyone!",0
"First off, I just want to say that this game is not as inappropriate for teens as some of the other reviews make it seem. There’s no visible sex or full scale nudity in the games - the worst it gets is partially visible breasts and implied intercourse (the screen goes dark and you hear a bit of moaning, but that’s the extent of it). The cursing is nothing a teen wouldn’t be familiar with, with words like f**k, b**ch, and on a rare use of c**t. Even the cursing is occasional though, and doesn’t happen often. The violence is comparable to games like Skyrim, and although some of the cutscenes are a tad bit darker, they can still be handled by mature teams.
In terms of positive role models, Geralt (the main character), may not be a shining white knight who is perfect by every standard, but that’s part of what makes him compelling. He’s grim, and occasionally does dubious things like bedding prostitutes, but overall he always does the right thing, whether it be saving innocent lives even when it’s in his best interest to walk away, or spending his life fighting evil so that others don’t have to.
To summarize, 14-15 yr olds can most definitely play this, and perhaps even very mature 13 yr olds. Honestly, your biggest concern might be that they don’t understand all of subtleties in terms of plot and politics. But if they enjoyed reading A Game of Thrones or other complex books - and could grasp the intricacies and twists of it with enjoyment, they’re definitely ready for this, although I would argue Game of Thrones is much, much more political.",0
"The Witcher 3 is a dark, gritty, gruesome and violent video game with lots of nudity and sex.
Under no circumstances should any child under 18 be allowed to play it. The game uses extreme profanity, blasphemy and crude sexual language throughout. The violence is gory, with sword fights often leading to decapitations, gutting, and severing bodies in two. Bloody and violent throughout.
There are prolonged scenes of female nudity, as well as sex scenes and sexual discussions. The game is 10/10 adult and NO child should play it.",0
"This game is strictly NOT recommended for anyone underage gamer. If I had to move down a few notches, I'd stop at 16, and even so, only if the player can handle adult themes maturely. I'll admit that I have played many 18+ games back in the day, but again, those games were dated and none too serious. The most ""Adult"" games I'd played at that age were from the Assassin's Creed franchise. I've always handled violence maturely since I was pretty young, never had violent thoughts (they've existed, but I can say with absolute certainty that they weren't fueled by the games but because of other hardships) or went about raping anyone. It was during my mid - teens when I actually played games that had strong sexual content, but I was mature enough to handle them. But enough of all that. My point is that myself and a few of my friends were able to handle such content maturely, but not every kid is the same, especially now that the gaming industry has evolved so much. I'm positive that I would never have been able to handle my games maturely if they were as graphic as they are today. The sexual content in the game can be skipped, but gore is prominent throughout the game. Moreover, the story and the thematic setting of the game itself are pretty hard for kids to comprehend. Do NOT let your young kids play this game, it can get extremely addictive. We don't know if they can handle it maturely, so its best not to risk it. There are other more appropriate games (that are also good, ofc) that they can play, so please lean towards them.
That said, if you're 18 or above, you will enjoy this game. The story changes thematically several times, but each of them are given much focus and cooked up with intricacy. There are several side quests that you can take up, which allows you to delve deeper into the character and the setting. Its also crucial that you try out the expansions as well, especially Blood &amp; Wine. With a story independent of the MC and a long campaign (long enough to be a separate project), it plays out so perfectly to the conclusion of the protagonist's adventures. The game may have turned 4 this year, but its still solid gold! I'd recommend that you play the previous instalments as well, while each game has its own story independent of each instalment, it does give you a whole new feel playing as the protagonist when you've explored all of his adventures. A true masterpiece of a game!",0
"This game is absolutely incredible but it does have quite a bit of gore in it. It’s in third person so it’s not as severe as a game like Doom but it’s still fairly gory. I personally don’t think much about sex, but I know most parents do so I’m including this here. Any mature teenager can probably handle this game. It’s not like they don’t know that these things exist or haven’t seen them. And let’s be real, if you’ve been on the internet you’ve almost definitely seen pornography. This game does have some good role models and is one of the best games my daughter and I have ever played. If your child or in this case teen is mature, then they can almost definitely handle this game.",0
"First off, I would like to say that this game is not nearly as bad as the Common Sense Media review would have you believe. Early teenagers can definitely handle this game, and despite what parents would like to believe, they’ve probably seen worse.
First off, violence. I find in most reviews, gore is often greatly exaggerated. In truth, even in the bloodiest games (which this does not even fall under) the “gore” is some red splashes, and little more. The Witcher is comparable to Skyrim in this sense, and unless your child was extremely sheltered from violence for all their life or feel sick at the sight of blood, they will be fine! In fact, you’re probably more scared or uncomfortable at the sight of blood than they are. Most teens are not fragile, and you treating them as such will only irritate and insult them.
Secondly, sex and nudity. Again, many parents might underestimate their child’s ability to handle this. But let’s be honest - if they really want to see nudity and sex, they will, and no parental restrictions or stern lectures will stop them. With the internet and the increasing virtual connectivity in our society, they will find it, and you will likely never know. Hell, if they’re above the age of 15 or 16, they’re statistically probably not even a virgin. So trust your kids. If you tell them they’re not allowed to play the game because of this or if you try and disable cutscenes, it’ll only make them more determined and curious, and I can guarantee, you won’t win that battle. Besides, the nudity and suggestiveness in the Witcher is fairly light anyway, with the extent of it being the occasional breast or butt, along with a bit of suggestive moaning.
Thirdly, language and drinking. As far as language goes, the Witcher doesn’t have anything a kid might not hear at school, using a fair bit of f**k, s**t, and the rare (though more offensive) c**t. While it’s hardly tame, again, they have probably heard it all before (maybe even from you!) so it shouldn’t be too bad. Where drinking is concerned, the Witcher is quite heavy on it in some parts, but that should only be a problem for you if alcohol is treated as a “forbidden fruit” at your table. If kids are curious, let them have a little to taste. Chances are, they’ll hate it, and probably won’t even consider drinking for quite a while.
Luckily drugs are virtually non-existent, unless you count magical potions as drugs, which I think is ridiculous.
And finally, although the tone of the story may be dark, there are countless small messages and characters throughout the game who are positive role models and send positive messages. It is up to the player how to act, and they can be a gruff disillusioned realist to a kind, caring protector.
So to conclude, I would recommend the game for ages 14+, for teens can most definitely handle its content.",0
"I agree with the other reviews but one element missing from them is the beauty of the game, the artwork and the music. This game focus is the puzzle and the exploration of the island - the puzzle is not simple, but this is a great experience to do with your kids.",1
"Beautiful open platform game, which would be great for younger kids, but the puzzles are definitely for older kids and not so easy.
Which means it is great for adults to share with children",1
"This game is great for those who need a beginner openish world adventure game. The puzzles are challenging and the theme appropriate for a child. A younger child may not be able to understand the full mechanics of the control scheme or layout of the world. It is a story of a young boy who wakes up on a mysterious island's shoreline, and you must navigate through the world and a tall tower to reach the top. The reason is unknown at first, and as the story progresses more is revealed. The ending is sad, as it turns out the boy died and his father is shown mourning for his boy in the boys room. This is really the only concern I had with my 5 year old son, as it is something you may need to explain.",1
"It helps a kids imagination, Totally recommend",1
"Very fun game, Has very mild violence, It can be ages 8 and up.",1
"This game is a must if you have children who love planes and anything to do with aviation, also there are repaints you can download from sites to addons for scenery, on the flipside you will need a decent GPU like an Nvidia RTX 3080 and an intel icore 7 to run it at decent settings, other than that the price tag is the same as No Man's Sky $60.00 for the standard addition alone while the deluxe and premium are several dollars more.",1
Parents give your kids this game . Only positive side effects,1
This is amazing great for your kids! Extremely Educational!,1
"My 10 year old begs to do this, he gets sweaty and tired after an hour. My 4 year old wanted to try, he loves it and only needs help reading the story and a few instructions. He does great too, sweaty and happy and gets tired. Nothing too scary or mature.
It gives them both great exercise, at their level, and they think its so much fun they want it every day, sometimes twice a day. It does target all the major muscle groups and gives decent aerobics. Gives tips on staying healthy, hydrated, reminds kids to drink water, rest, listen to their bodies. Virtual smoothies teach about healthy foods.
My husband and I tried it, and for us it was fun, just not fun enough that we want to do it every day. We got a decent workout too.",1
"Snipperclips was the first game our family bought for the Nintendo Switch, and confirmed that we made the right decision on this console. We spent HOURS over DAYS working together to solve the puzzles, laughing at the weird conversations that spiraled from our gameplay.
Manipulating the characters, cuts, and objects really helped my son's hand-eye coordination, and helped him meet a lot of spatial development goals.
The game is overall cute, quirky, positive, and just challenging enough to make you want to come back for more.",1
All of my kids love this game.,1
"Very simple looking puzzles at first look, but is more challenging than it looks at first. For 2 or more players they have to work together to solve the puzzles so good to encourage cooperation. Content is fine for younger children but they may find it too difficult.",1
"This game is terrific to play with your child! Frankly, the best I've seen so far! Whether its appropriate for you child depends on their gamer ability. My 6 3/4 year old boy has played video games for years. Mostly on the iPad but he is adept at Minecraft on the Xbox 360. In the past we had had failed attempts at the various Lego games. Though he mastered Lego Dimensions. I thought this side-scroller may be challenging for him but he took to it like a fish to water. We BOTH loved it. There are 7 primary levels in the game and the first 3 or 4 are pretty easy. After that the puzzles got quite challenging. But, he stuck with it. The game also allows my child's character to climb on my back and I take over for the two of us. This was useful in some of the challenging parts. But, surprisingly, I climbed on his back a few times for areas I found difficult and he was better at.
One other thing I liked is that this game 'forces' the two of you to play together. Whenever we played video games in the past I always felt like the 'wing-man'. The support team. My son only ever cared about his achievements and what he did. This is the first time we really played together because it was important. He couldn't advance if I didn't and vice versa. So it forced him to work WITH me for the first time ever in a video game.
As others have said, there is a 'background' story playing out in the background. My son always called them 'dreams'. Some of it seems like its a bit disturbing - a tween getting in to trouble or being chased etc. But, my son and I mostly ignored it. The background stuff does seem a bit creepy. I honestly didn't understand what was going on back there or the point of it. As I said, we mostly ignored it.
The game is REALLY terrific. It's cute, fun, playful, beautiful and the single best time this father has had playing a video game with his son yet! I couldn't recommend it to a parent and any child 6 and above who is reasonably adept at using the controller and generally familiar with game playing mechanics.",1
"So far my favorite to play with my 3 year old. It's a unique puzzle platformer that requires you to work together, but it also has a helping mechanic where you can just pull up the other player up by tightening the yarn and having the other player pull himself up. Without that, it wouldn't be accessible until much later age. It didn't take long to get a hang of things and eventually we were able to tackle the harder puzzles. Your mileage may vary especially not knowing your toddler's experience with platformer genre/mechanics.",1
"Great gameplay and graphics. I love the cooperation aspect of the game as it encourages teamwork. There are some scenes in the background with ghost like figures where kids are scared and running from bad guys. My 7yr old thinks they are zombies and says it’s a little scary. He’s also fine with Lord of the Rings movies so there is a certain creepy ness factor which is why I gave it an 8yr rating. I also wish that the yarn characters didn’t have “horns”. Again, the game play and graphics are awesome! Lastly, some scenes are calm and the next you might be chased by a large bird or fire amber so that could impact some children.",1
It's not inappropriate it is really good for kids/adults who like mario and or sonic,1
"My age recommendation may be a bit young but in my opinion, the ability to remove any song you believe inappropriate from the song playlist makes this a kid friendly skating game.",1
Any age can play this! It’s really fun and colorful and it’s really happy and positive and fun for all ages. The only scariness is falling into the abyss off the map if someone throws you but that’s all!,1
"Fall Guys is really fun. It got popular really fast, and it makes sense why. The player must complete obstacle courses, survival games, and team games as jelly beans in costumes. It's hilarious.
Cons:
Frustrating. Some maps are unfair and the gameplay is still a little buggy.
of course, like any other 2015-2020ish game, it has a Battle Pass.",1
"This game is one of the best games launched on steam. Here’s some reasons why: Suitable for kids, family friendly but costs money though.",1
"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of my favourite multiplayer games. Each of it's mini-games are unique, fun, and utterly hilarious. Even after playing many, many rounds it's still fresh and exciting. In addition, Fall Guys' in-game currencies can be earned easily from playing, rather than paying. You can buy Kudos (the in-game currency) if you want to, but it is very, very easy to earn just by performing well. Fall Guys is fun on it's own, but playing with friends is an absolute blast. So is it worth the £15 price tag? Definitely. 8/10.",1
"nothing concerning,at all.
It can be frustrating sometimes but overall fun game",1
it is a very fun and good game and it is worth its price tag,1
"This game is easy to learn and fun to play for all age groups. Most young children (5+) should be able to play on easy settings - though it will take time. Older kids should pick it up easily straight away. Besides being fun this game teaches coordination, timing, and rhythm. If it is mirrored to a TV it is also good fun for the whole family as every family member can watch one another play the game.",1
"Beat Saber is an incredible game. It's definitely an essential for anyone with a VR headset. Slashing blocks in time to the music is surprisingly addictive and enjoyable, although after a while it does get a bit repetitive. Most of the songs available are actually pretty good, but there are some that, well, aren't. You might enjoy all the songs though, as (of course) different people like different types of music. I was however a bit annoyed that you had to pay to unlock some songs, but it's not a huge problem seeing as the library of free songs is pretty big. To conclude, Beat Saber is a game that I would highly recommend to anyone lucky enough to own a headset. It's also not too bad of a workout. 8.5/10.",1
The game is too easy oops accidentally did it blindly in a pretty quick time.,1
My five year old beat the game in under an hour when not even trying to beat it fast It gets a 2 star rating for it being to easy just like the first two did,1
"Don't listen to the Karen's, this is the most fun I've had in a while! Children adored it. Would highly recommend!",1
"This game is realistic - it reflects what a zombie apocalypse would be like. Your actions have consequences. This game does not shy away from gore - including the harming of teenagers. You play as a teenager - who can die. Your character is taking care of a young child, who ends up shooting someone in the head. Characters, including said teens, can die onscreen. It's more of a ""Can my child distinguish fantasy from reality?"" situation. The gore, at least in my opinion, is animated with an artsy style, so it's not terrifying to look at. It's violent, and evokes a lot of emotions. If your child's played through the series, this isn't too much. It's violent, but the game is based on hard decisions. Save one person over the other? Pacifist? It's a game that runs like a good book - and I say 14+",0
"It uses the same unreal engine 3 with updated version and looks better still has the same beautiful music.
HOWEVER and a big Unfortunately what RUINS THIS GAME. If you are also a Christian Catholic, orthodox or follow Judaism.
Even with extreme content filter it has blasphemies such as they use G-ds name to condemn someone the extreme content filter/aka also known as profanity and gore filter does not unfortunately eliminate nor remove blasphemies and the game uses the name of Our lord in vain.
Even Rod the director of this game explains right before he made this game that in Gears of war 4 they will not filter all words out only the f word. They also applied the same exact concept for this gears of war ultimate edition.

Extreme content filter does remove only the F-word and gore violence and blood (but not the gore is not removed from the cinematics.)",0
i think it is a little bit bloody but my child is fine and he is 8. 2 year olds aren't supposed to play video games. this game is bloody and has lots of cursing but i would recommend it for 8 year olds.,0
"My entire family enjoys playing this game. There are some weapons used, but most of the material in this game is well thought out by the developers to be cartoonish safe fun for fairly young audiences. The levels can be challenging, but a child can figure them out with enough practice. I would encourage parents to play this with their kids as it can be a fun bonding experience talking about the history of the characters as well as the story as it develops.",1
This game offers kids a unique way to learn to express themselves through art. Its art lessons can be easily applied to real art. And it creates such a supportive environments. Perfect for both girls and boys.,1
"My 9 year old loves it. She needs a little help with reading some of it. She is learning some new vocabulary words, though!",1
"Seriously, the Imagine games are disturbing. They're insulting to people's intellect and they're just plain creepy. They seem to appeal to younger players but also feel as if they're aimed at older gamers. Not to mention these games are a tad sexist. Besides, video games are supposed to be fun, not educational. Imagine games are stupid. There, I said it and I mean it. They are stupid beyond all compare. My friend made me try one of these out as a joke and if I wasn't such a softie, I'd get back at her for that. But I guess some good came out of it. After all, I never paid for it and I can give you this message: Never buy yours kids any of the Imagine games. Also, parents, most female gamers tend not to aim towards the girly games, so don't insult your daughter's intelligence.",0
"My daughter who enjoys puzzles, really likes this game. I enjoyed this game also! You are required to think creatively how to best use your marker tool and limited ink in order to draw physical solutions. Its a great feeling when the lightbulb turns on figuring out the solution. The further you get into the game, the harder they are to solve. Excellent game.",1
"My 10 year old loves this. The more creative the better the game. My 8 year old is learning difference btwn adverb, adjective, nouns, verbs.",1
"This was an good game. One of the great things parents are probably looking for is that it is very educational. Some of the levels are almost impossible without hints. Another thing I would like to say is that there is violence. But, it is very cartoon like, and when you destroy something or someone they just poof of of the screen. There is NO blood or gore.
As for if it is fun game, I'd say that you can get addicted pretty easily. At least that is what happened to me. One of the funnest parts is the title screen. Maxwell is in a playground, and you can just mess around. Once you want to go to single player, multi-player, or customized levels, then just tap the start button in the bottom left corner, and you're starting an adventure.",1
There is a crossbow which makes kids explode into guts. Dora frequently says the F word when referring to boots and calls him a S word. Dora is a violent waste and will ruin your christian family. l will let my kids play gta before this.,0
"It's a good game to test your skill within certain game categories, but after a while you get bored because it seems repetitive and get discouraged when your Brain Age grade never gets higher than C+ (I don't want to know what that says about me). My nephew was discouraged after averaging a Brain Age grade of C and although he practiced games within the practice portion, he just couldn't get into it because, according to him, ""the challenge is no longer there, especially when I keep getting a C."" And so, we both gave the game a break and played Scrabble.",1
"Highly addictive game, me and hubby and in contest to beat each others score, and our 6 year old thinks its great, needs a bit of help with the reading but the puzzles adapt to all levels, would not besuitable for anyone under the age of 6.",1
This game is fantastic!! It puts the unique DS stylus to good use. Your brain will thank you!,1
"Wii Sports is a truly complex, beautiful and breathtaking game. It’s by far the greatest Mario game.",1
"Wii Sports Is The BEST Video Game EVER Created
I've gone pro in all sports except golf.",1
"I just LOVE this game. However, I find Tennis and Bowling easier.",1
"This is a classic Wii game that is perfectly fine for all ages! I love all of the sports, but my favorite is probably baseball. The rules for every sport work a little differently than how the rules work for the same sports in real life, but that doesn’t take away from how fun and exciting the game is. Also, it has INCREDIBLE music! I love listening to just the music itself sometimes. I highly recommend it to adults and children alike. The whole family will thoroughly enjoy this game, along with the many other games that go with Wii and Wii U.",1
The game is actually good for fitness and sport sometimes people play it for fun The bowling is kinda hard to use,1
It’s just like real life sports no violence or foul language it can teach children to play certain sports and is a fun game for the whole family on the Nintendo Wii,1
It's a fun game but it gets boring quick,1
"This is a very good game. With good sports man ship, Wii baseball rules!!! forever
Cool game + fun= wii sports !! :)",1
"This is a great game for the whole family to play at one time. It gets everyone moving! We often have tournaments, plus there are many different sports you can play. It is so much fun, even my 3 year old enjoys it!",1
Loved playing all the games except the boxing.,1
"My name is Etienne bland and I think the wii is a great game like the way you could move with the characters
on the games I also like how it give you a work but I would like it eve morn if could make a game call saban entertainment because Im a big fan of saban entertainment fan and I think it will make a good game here are the names I would you to make into game Superhuman Samurai,Masked Rider, VR Troopers, Beetleborgs, and Mystic Knights you can make the game into one cd that will be cool",1
when i first got the wii i played WII SPORTS and it was so fun!!! It's acualy fun plus you exersing too.,1
"I am pretty good at Bowling and Boxing!
It's so much fun!",1
A must-play game for every 2 year old,1
"This is a great game for the whole family. Smaller children may find the Wii controls challenging to master, but that is the reason this game was made--to teach hand-eye coordination in a fun way. Its also good for helping children share, take turns, and be good sports.
My kids loved making their own characters to play with--its a refreshing change from your normal gaming experience.
Its a fine addition to any family's game time together.",1
"WII FIT is an exciting way for kids and adults to exercise using the Wii console. It's a compilation of 40+ games to play on the Wii Balance Board, a special peripheral that comes packaged with the game. The Wii Balance Board looks like a giant scale that sits on the floor. When you stand on it, it can detect the slightest shifts in your balance, which means it can tell if you are leaning forward or backward, and from side-to-side. In addition to balance, the board can also determine your weight. The games are broken into four categories: aerobics, balance, yoga, and strength training. Under aerobics, you can hula-hoop, do step-aerobics, run (next to, not on the board), or rhythm-box. The yoga activities teach you how to breathe and do yoga poses. Strength training shows you how to do a variety of exercises including lunges, torso twists, and push-ups, all using the board. The balance games are the most fun because they have you heading soccer balls, skiing down slopes, performing ski-jumps, snowboarding, and walking on tightropes, as well as pretending to be a table with balls on it you tilt by leaning back and forth, and a bubble that you control through a maze by moving your body.
Retails at $89",1
"For kids that don't get enough energy out by being inside on a rainy day, this is a great alternative and gets the entire family involved as well as helps establish goals.",1
this game is somewhat fun and age apropreat for ages 6 and up. but kids will probably not enjoy it until they are 8.,1
You just need to remember to go in and adjust your child's height occassionally as they grow so that it doesn't mess up the BMI.,1
"Wii Fit has a fun set of games, with enough variety that you can choose what you want to do and avoid the games that drive you nuts! They system is well designed, with many of the exercises guiding the user to the correct form by the very nature of the design. It is challenging and many of the activities are a good workout.",1
"I think this game is great! Our 3 year old attempts to do the excercise and activities, but they are just beyond her abilities. I love the fact that fitness has become a ""game"".",1
"My mother, my niece, and myself all play almost daily on my Wii Fit. For my niece, in particular, it was an amazing tool. We've been trying to help her lose some weight (on recommendation of her pediatrician), but nothing has really been able to help motivate her to do anything. However, after watching her Mii grow in size, she finally understood why we wanted to help her. And even better, she can play on Wii Fit for hours before we finally force her to take a break. She doesn't even really realize that she's exercising! It's perfect for what we needed.",1
"I really love this game. I'm a total couch potato, and I've tried other home fitness equipment and gym memberships to no avail. I just can't stick with them long enough to do any good, but this has been a lot of fun. I've been playing three times a week for a month, and I can feel that I'm getting stronger.
On the down side I will say that my five-year-old daughter was unhappy to be rated overweight, so when she wasn't looking I adjusted her height a couple of inches, so now she's very excited to get a normal rating.
I'll also say that some of the fitness tips are less than helpful, and I wish it did more to help plan a workout strategy; for example, it already tracks which activities I complete each day, so it wouldn't be so much more complicated to come up with a recommendation of activities for the next day; for example, abs today, thighs tomorrow or strength today aerobic tomorrow. Something like that.
My three-year old son's favorite activity is running in place. He's hilarious. He pumps his little feet on the carpet like someone is chasing him!",1
Its an an awesome game you don't need to worry,1
"It is a great game, but it might be confusing for people under 9 years old.
nothing is bad about the game. But younger kids wouldn't understand it,
so I recommend only getting this game for people 8+. It also has great educational value. GREAT GAME!!",1
"My 9 year old plays this game - and I played a little bit too. As another reviewer said, this game really is 4 mini-games, and it's supposed to show the evolution of a creature from cellular stage in the ocean to a space faring race. Overall it's a fun game to play, and we both enjoyed the first two stages. The game lost me at the 3rd stage, where the controls got changed, and the tutorial was poor. My 9 year old persevered, and got through to the end. He says that it's kind of strange - the game goes from cell life to organism, from organism to animal, from animal to tribes. Then suddenly it skips ahead from tribes to battle tanks - a drastic jump in his mind. He would have expected a bit more in between. I did see the science being taught in this, though it did lean more towards ""intelligent design"" than actual evolution. I wouldn't use this as more than a place to start a discussion about evolution, and how it's different than this. But it's a fun game, and more intelligent than most video games out there. Worth the money, I thought.",1
Adorable but smart the only negative I can see with Spore is that it can be addictive! The whole family can play.,1
The game has a wonderful interface and is very easy to learn. It also moves at a good pace. It is much easier to play than most strategy games making great for young gamers.,1
Love that kids learn by experimenting.,1
"A cool platformer for the Playstation. Youre a Sackboy that you can later dress in different ways. You go to an adventure in different beautifully created stages and collect bubbles. A few spooky were made with a Halloween theme, but nothing too scary to give you nightmares. This game is very kid friendly, online community is somewhat fun. Just watch out for online bullies. There's also create your own stage in Little Big Planet that you can share online, the only limit is your imaginations and creativity skills. There are game trophies to achieve as well and DLCs to get but it's mostly cosmetics that doesnt affect gameplay. Controls are easy to master if you pay attention in the first stage. Graphics and sounds are also very pleasing. All in all, any child that can work a controller will like this fun and vibrant game. Its a must own by all Playstation 3 owners.",1
"This game released when I was 20 years old. It's one of the best creative games back then in the late 2000's. While this game is very far from blood and gore, it is pretty dangerous going around the levels the games and the community provide you. You have spike, electrical objects, fire objects, gas objects, and more things to kill you cute sackboy or sackgirl. I also mentioned sexual content in the game. While this game doesn't naturally have sex in the game, there is a offline mode in the game where you have blocks to build with from your adventures in Story Mode. This, however, is a very modified service, and whenever the LBP staff sees inappropriate content in the game, they tend to take it down or just report it. But, however, it may never be noticed and little kids will be exposed to it. However, in the game there is one character in the game that is smoking pot, but I think that was super rare in the game for younger kids to see, so there isn't really a concern for that. There is also a option in the game to join another person's pod (personal lobby space) which the hosts can bully the guests, Ways the people can leave is going to settings, host kicking them out of their pod, or losing connection to the Internet. Otherwise, the story line plot is pretty good and there's so many positive role models and messages to take down the villian of Story Mode.",1
I don't care what people say! This is one of the best games i ever played back in 2016 and live on to this day. This is like my 3rd year playing the game. Best game next to Angry Birds and Mario and Pok A mon,1
"This cheap bit of hardware let’s players show their imagination to the world! It’s cool, and if for some reason u don’t want them looking at player made, turn of the internet!",1
"We love this game which is fun to play as an adult or child. It's a fast moving game so a younger child (6) may find it challenging depending on how dexterous they are.
We like the story and narration, the ability to customise your character, the challenge of the levels and the ability to create your own games. The community area can have some hazards as a couple of reviewers have noted. Our child only has access to community features when supervised for this reason.",1
"As an introduction to gaming and gaming consoles this game was terrific for my daughter who was 6 when I got it for her. It might require some help at first with pre-readers, but it is fun to play along with your kids and can be just as stimulating and exciting to grown-ups as children.
I know some adults who love this game and I enjoy it when I need to relax a little.
I love the creativity and ability to influence their own environment that this game allows too. There are follow-ups too so if we get tired of this one we can move on to LBP2 or LBP3.
I would caution against online access for very young players though as there is a tendency among online players to corrupt the game a little with extra violence and references which might well disturb very young viewers.
But then again I'd not advise un-monitored and unsupervised online gaming for anyone under at least 14 years of age anyway, and even then parents need to allow it with mindful of what their individual child is capable of coping with.
Whenever there is an online component to a game there are safety and privacy issues which need to be considered.",0
This game came with the play station we bought. The game seems harmless and appropriate for kids (ours are ages 4 thru 12 we have 5 kids) BUT anyone is allowed to create a level and characters that everyone can access. There are characters called slinderman and Jeff the killer that my kids found and started talking about and liking them. We got rid of the game after that. Then just today a story came out on the news that 2 12yr old girls tried to kill their best friend by stabbing her 19 times in an attempt to impress slinderman...no those characters are not made by the game maker itself but the fact that those types of characters are allowed on that game and accessible to small children makes this game TOTALLY inappropriate for anyone under 16 or so.,0
"First of all, it is a very creative and engaging game.
BUT, I would not recommend allowing any child younger than 12 or 13 connecting to the community and playing user-generated levels/worlds. Here are a few things that I have personally witnessed:
Some themes: death row, complete with electric chair; tsunami, where everyone is drowning and dying; walls with the ""f word"" scrawled all over them; worlds where ""blood"" is splattered everywhere...
I have also seen players saying rude/crude things to one another, including cursing and my son has received a multitude of strange messages from people about arguments between players.
In addition, players whose names include years such as 1974, etc. whom I assume to be adults have tried to ""friend"" him.
Needless to say, we have gotten rid of this game. Allowing any child younger than 13 or 14 to play this while connected to the community is like allowing them to particpate in a virtual ""no man's land"". Not good. Not good at all.",0
"Very family- friendly game, with an adorable little character that you can customize and solve puzzles with.",1
It is the absolute best game I have ever played! The sequel is also extremely good.,1
"This is appropiate for any age really, But a huge problem is it will bore anyone younger than 10. It bored me within about 15 minutes. Its like a failing Mario. The sack person can die but it isn't violent. Its just for people who don't get bored of rubbish. The problem is I will willingly play Call of duty for 12 hours straight. But I couldn't possibly do that with this game. I just got rid of it instantly. Traded it in and got half what I paid. I'm not happy with it. It will entertain 6 year olds.",1
Great for the whole family!,1
"My husband and I love this game, my 4yo son likes it but it's difficult for him to play...great fun game - even just to watch!",1
"All three of my children loved this game, from first playing in my lap around 2 yrs. old and my youngest is still asking to play at 9 yrs. If you're a parent or grandparent wanting a first video game for your little one(s), this is a great choice.",1
"It's a very fun and challenging puzzle game. The learning curve is spot-on and the game guides you through every mechanic.
Maybe the most important part is the message it transmits, though. Reading each of the messages in each level will guide you through the lore of the Universe and tell you the story about the World of Goo Corporation, and the dangers of excessive greed and amoral ""progress"". While telling this, it also does excellent critique of social issues like materialism and pollution.
Although the overall message is more oriented towards teen, mature audiences, it doesn't detract from the main gameplay experience, and may add up for a totally different second gameplay for your children years after the initial one. Totally recommended!",1
"This game is adorable. I'd recommend it to kids even younger, but I'm not sure at what point it would start getting too difficult for them. The puzzles can be challenging for adults and children alike...a great indie game to pass the time. For what it is, a simple game with a simple objective and a simple yet quirky and very creative objective and characters, I say game on! There's absolutely nothing in this that could possibly be bad for kids....unless your worried about the violence of popping a ball of goo.",1
"This is a wonderful game. It teaches simple physics and engineering in a fun and interesting way. As I play it on a computer, it has very simple click and drag controls. Some of the puzzles might frustrate younger children, but it's still an amazing game.",1
"Great game, learning about physics while you creatively build structures to gain points of goo you collect. My child who likes puzzles enjoys this and Max &amp; the Magic Marker. I had a lot of fun playing it too. Would be fine for a 7 year old who likes puzzles, but gets easier and more interesting the older they are. Nothing offensive or questionable about this. And there's no tension over the amount of time to complete them.",1
"My kids (3 and 5) love to sit with me and tell me what to do with the cute little goo balls. Beautiful game all around.
Kids could take this game on solo around 7 or so. 5 is too young to do the precise clicking that's needed on some levels.",1
"World of Goo is an amazing game (the music is among the best) This game is a brilliant metaphor for humanity with surprisingly relevant messages about resource, industry, development, and progress.
www.sheeparcade.com",1
"Awesome, simple game. My 6 year old is glued to this game. He can easily solve the early puzzles, needs a little help past level 15-20. My husband and I enjoy it, too. No speed involved, just brain power. Take your time on each level, try again as many times as you need to solve a level -- there is no penalty for mistakes and taking your time. You can even redo levels as many times as you'd like to see if you can come up with a better solution.
The downside is that the instructions are minimal, so it's hard to know what tools you have at your disposal. There is a demo video on the CPD website that helps.
Enjoy!",1
"I haven't actually played Calamity Trigger, but I have played Continuum Shift (On the PS3), and I must say that it is a really good fighter game with fairly mild violence, but I found that through the story mode that there was frequent use of bad language, and some sexual humor that I would have expected from an M game, but other than that, its good.",0
"We just picked this up yesterday along with Wii Fit Plus, it's a fun game that makes you move while playing it. My favorite game is 100 pin bowling!",1
"This game promotes exercise and kids need to start exercising early in life so they learn the importance of it! Your children will have fun while staying fit! Adults will also love this game, it's a great workout!",1
"This game is simple and fun for the entire family. We actually got the game because I enjoyed playing it so much when we tried it out on the in-law's wii. But the wonderful thing about it is that has appeal for everyone and is simple enough that even younger kids can play yet challenging enough that adults will find it fun as well.
One of the great things about this game is that there are LOTS of games within the game itself and most all of them are fun and value-added (with a few exceptions depending on what you enjoy). Just the airplane flying alone will provide hours of fun for anyone in the family.
One thing to note is that some games (such as the airplane game) only allow one player while most of the other games can be played by yourself or with multiple players. You must have a special add-on for your remote that makes it more sensitive for each remote being used, though. So it can get quite expensive if you want the entire family to play. That said, I think the remote can be shared on some games (such as frisbee golf or bowling).
This game is a big hit in our house and my husband turns of the playstation occasionally to play this instead. I definitely recommend it for all ages.",1
"I have been searching for Wii titles that my non-gamer kids would like and could pick up quickly. This is the one that has stood out. Swordplay, wakeboarding, ping pong and archery are their favorites. All are easy to learn and engaging. Their friends love playing as well.
The game does have some duds though. Namely, jetski slalom, rowing and cycling. Not much fun here. The other downside is that you have to purchase another Wiiremote ""add-on"" to play two players. So total cost can exceed $80. If you have the original Wii system.",1
"We got this for our family with two children, 2 &amp; 4. While the littlest one can&#039;t play it, she loves to see her Mii on the TV and identifies all our Miis. Our four-year-old loves the flying games, frisbee, table tennis and sword fighting. He&#039;s also doing the archery, basketball and golf. The one he really has a tough time with is the wakeboarding, but it&#039;s a great way to teach him to persevere and keep trying to learn something new. We focus on being a gracious winner and a good loser and I think he has learned a lot. Whenever he plays, we play with him so he&#039;s only playing a few times a week, but I think that&#039;s plenty.",1
"This is a really great game for the whole family. We played this at home with my mom (""grandma""), 9 year old and myself - my mom scored the highest at bowling and she never plays video games! My son struggled with the game some because the directions are written on the screen and he struggles with reading so he ignores written directions. Some of the games we have had to try a couple of times before we caught on to how to play. However, it is a lot of fun and people can play against one another.",1
"Great activities. The sword fighting or fencing might be an issue for some, but all characters are wearing pads and helmets, so it's clear you aren't injuring anyone. My kids enjoy the plane flying, archery and fencing the most, and they are fun for adults too. The planes can be used to 'dogfight', but balloons play a large role in the targets, and no characters are hurt.",1
"Everyone in my family loves this game. It has a great mix of games which use thinking, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, stamina or speed. If you get tired of any one area you can try different levels or games.",1
"With boy/girl twins, it's hard to find a game they both can play together - this is it! A lot of fun for parents to play too.",1
"This is a fun game for the whole family. Specifically the airpline flyover, table tennis, basketball, swords. Yeah, this isn't hard core gaming or anything, and for less sophisticated gaming controls it can be frustrating for kids. My 3 year old handles no problem, my 6 year old has a hard time. But it's fun and worth trying out.",1
this game is fun and easy to play most kids 6 and up will enjoy it.,1
We love it. I don't usually like video games but this one is fun and very active!,1
"Nintendo, I want new, interesting games for the Wii, and that's what you promised to the world when the Wii came out a few years ago. But now...we see the Wii has turned into something of a child's toy with a limited library of kiddish games, and very few good ones. Again, if you want real exercise, your going to have to go out and do it yourself. Video games were meant to relax and unwind from the day, not to waggle you hand around in the air like a air traffic controller covered in bees. This game is fun for kids and those who didn't spend a lot of time trying the included Wii Sports game. Otherwise, it is not worth it for those over 12+. Please, release some decent game for the Wii, Nintendo (other than Brawl or Metroid Prime 3).",1
"As long as your kids aren't dyeing to play ""swordplay"" and hit people with their plastic sword this game is fine!!!",1
"This is a delightful and engaging game where the player tries to build up his kingdom by sending citizen characters on a variety of tasks.
As stated in the review there is no blood, but there is the notion of conflict (e.g. combat w/ monster turnips). I think the fact that the citizens have names and the player can develop feelings for them is good, and when the ""die"" a feeling of sadness. As king it is your job to take care of your people. I think that in game compassion and a sense of loss is much better than senseless killing w/o any concern.
As for innuendo, there is an off reference to cleavage, but when citizens fall in love, sending to get married is not a bad thing.",1
"Children Under 17 Should Not Watch It Because It Is Way To Violent. They Should Look At Games Like Naruto, Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spider Man, They Could Of Left Out Blood.",0
"I thought this game was incredible. It had just been so long without a decent stealth game to add with splinter cell and the other top stealth games. It is violent but it is rated 15 and without the violence the game wouldn't be the same. The best part is that i got this game free a couple of weeks ago by using
www.rewards1.com/index.php?referrer_id=1426138
here's a link if any of you are interested and i admit I was a bit iffy about the site at first but i checked it out and it's completely safe and has got me many great games including this little gem",0
"Although the game is intriguing and fun, it's not something a parent wants to put in front of their teenage son. The Poison Ivy character is barely clothed, and teenage boys just don't need to have this seductive character thrown in front of their eyes. Too bad the makers had to add this. They could have sold more games to parents who try to monitor what their teenagers are looking at.",0
"This is the first in the iconic Arkham series and probably the tamest. The violence in this game is limited to Batman fighting thugs with his bare hands, sometimes the thugs will use pipes, knives, tazers and guns to try and kill Batman. There is no blood unless you count the walls which are decorated in barely visible blood. The language honestly isn’t that bad. If your child goes to a public school then they will hear worse everyday. Words include sh*t, ass, damn, hell one or two uses of b*****d and b*tch. At one stage batman has to follow a whisky trail ( and later a tobacco trail ) but no one is shown actually using these substances. As for sex, there is really nothing apart from some female villains wearing revealing clothing. Ok for 11 years and up",0
"There is some mild violence, (Punching, kicking, sometimes broken bones) and mild language. There are also some light horror elements, (Scarecrow missions)but it should be fine for most kids 12 and up and some younger kids. It all depends on the child.",0
The game has a bit of language and violence but you can choose not to repeat it. Over all this game should be fine for 11+,0
Very violent but a great game. At some parts of the game it is very scary. It's teen for a reason.,0
"This game is action packed and really fun to play. No drugs, alcohol or verbal profanity, but lots of violence. In this game, you aren't killing people, you are subduing them by knocking them out, Batman doesn't kill people. It is however, a very scary game. Lots of creepy visions, and a very creepy map. Overall though, I would highly recommend this game",0
This game is very fun it is pretty violent and there are some occasional b**chs t and some sexy stuff like poison ivy and harley quinn and some smoking and drinking but very fun game i beat it on my xbox 360.,0
"Growing up as a fan of the Beatles, I like the fact that this game has given my kids an appreciation for their music. We can enjoy most of the lyrics, while it also gives us an opportunity to talk about some of the later trippy songs that are obviously drug induced.",1
The game as some mild suggestive innuedo,0
"I have long been a fan of Beatles music, but I didn't expect it to be so overwhelmingly adored by all of my kids. Particularly interesting is that each one has their own favorites, without much overlap. The game itself is terrifically fun to play, and having everyone so invested in the song choices makes it a total blast.
Everyone in the house loves to play this game!",1
"The Beatles Rock Band is the first guitar/rock game that our whole family is able to truly enjoy. While previous Rock Band/Guitar Hero games have a few tunes all of us know, this is the first one that we know most of the songs, especially the lyrics. Give it a try! It's very fun to have kids singing Beatles songs, like ""All You Need is Love,"" ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" and ""Yellow Submarine."" These are great sing-along songs. The entire package is superbly done, again better than previous type games. We listened to an interview with one of the creators who explained that all four Beatles families were very involved in the game's creation, and it shows. Lots of photos. Great montages. Good details about the Beatles. For some kids, it could be a good way to discuss the history of the times. Kids we've played with it are fascinated how the Beatles' music, lyrics and looks changed.
Some of the tunes, including early ones, are not the easiest to play on drums or guitar. This may take some kids practice (or maybe they will just have to watch their parents practice.) That's different than previous type games which had only easy songs first. This game puts up songs by the date they were released. Even tho Ringo is often considered just an okay drummer, you'll be surprised how challenging the drum parts are.
The game doesn't take too long to complete. But there are going to be more songs released and higher scores release more information and songs. The game is a little pricey, but fun. You can have up to three people singing leads on microphones, even more singing harmony, then the 2 guitars and drums. Now that's a lot of people getting together!",1
"This is a great game for the whole family. It is really fun to play and the kids really enjoy it and now are getting into the Beatles. My 8 year old enjoys the guitar, drums and vocals but especially the drums. The instruments are a bit complicated for my just turned 5 year old. However, as she can read well, she loves the vocals aspect. It is extremely expensive but it really is a whole lot of fun. We also like the music a lot more than on the Guitar Heros and Rock Band and so do our kids.",1
"I bought this for my son for his birthday and we played it as a family last night. My husband has never played Guitar Hero and he LOVED it!!!! We stayed up until 11 pm playing it. We all have different levels of play ability. My daughter could play guitar on difficult, my husband on easy, my son's a drummer, so he did difficult and, of course, my singing was expert all of the time. My 11 year old wanted to watch, so she sang along with me and it was amazing how many songs she already knew and loved. There's something for everyone and a great family game we all can play! I didn't notice any songs that would be inappropriate, pretty mild compared to today's lyrics and most kids that age don't really know what they're singing along to anyway, just like we did when we were kids. I noticed as I was singing a long I didn't know a lot of the words that I thought I did. FUN!!",1
"I love it since it's a game the family can play together, and none of the songs is questionable. You can feel good playing all of them.",1
"Love it! There's something to be said about trying to sing or play songs that you know every note, as opposed to some of the Rock Band I and II songs that we may not have ever heard of. Also, the vocals are not complicated so they can be sung by a regular person.",1
"It's sooooo fun! I would laugh my head off as I dressed myself as a mom, and had a girl follow me, and a police officer would start raging! I love giving spoilt brats what they deserve, marrying 2 people, and much more!",1
"This is an awesome game. As far as some of the reviews, you will find something wrong with anything if you look for it. It encourages problem solving which many kids today are not learning in the current school system. Creativeness is important for proper development.",1
"My 10 year-old created a level in which a terrorist was about to blow up an atomic bomb, making me extremely disturbed. I did also notice some obscure internet memes like rickroll (a music video that is very common on YT), Keyboard cat (stuffed cat on a keyboard), and my kids favorites, 217 (huge exploding picture), Feep (robotic zombie), and Weegee (basically it's medusa gone wrong).",0
This is one of the best games for kids. It works on their reading and writing skills. We bought this for our 6 year old to help him work on his writing skills. He opted to use the (typing) keyboard instead which is still great. Now he knows his way and can find the keys with ease. I'm sure it helps re-inforce his spelling skills. He's one of his classes best spellers. Plus it's a good introduction to some mythological characters like Medusa and Pegasus.,1
"This is fantastic, imaginative game that has kept our 11 year old occupied for hours on recent long car trips. We liked that you can get 'hippy points' for solving the puzzles without weapons. It's amazing the number of items and interactions they've included in this innovative game.
Highly recommended!",1
"This game is encouraging my son to try to spell out more things on his own, and he is using his reading skills too. Both kids can share levels that they create and it's good to see them working together and laughing like crazy at the funny scenes they create. A lot of fun so far.",1
My son can't put it down. He will be 10 next month. He LOVES this game. We almost have to pry it from his hands. He was playing Pokemon and now has turned to this game. He is learning too! But don't tell the kids that or they won't want it.,1
I think it’s nice and hardworking program like a like and good one,1
"My daughters (ages newly 11, 8, and 3) don't really use technology but when they do they love playing Jumpstart! It's amazing, safe, and doesn't ever get boring!",1
"Jumpstart 3D Virtual World is amazing for my daughters, ages 9 4 and 2. Its one of those virtual worlds you don't have to worry about with social interaction. Who could've thought of such a valuable world? And the 3D graphics are stunning and intense!!!!",1
"My kids love this game. They play for hours. The best part is they get a good balance of education and fun. The Lands are very educational, lots of learning games. To earn the coins my kids have become masters at the learning games because those games give extra points! Teach your kids this and you will have math/reading/science in quantity!",1
"My boys (5 and 7) are really enjoying Jumpstart World. They've been thrilled with the new dragon training feature. I don't mind them playing but there are two things I think could really be better. First, I don't think it's as educational as it could be. Training a dragon is fun but there's really nothing to it in terms of math or reading. It's not even close to the educational quality provided by a site like Dreambox Math. Second, they can't play together. While not at all educational, something I enjoy about the Lego series or Scooby Doo Wii is that they can play together. With Jumpstart they just take turns with my older son most often getting more time to play. I think it's good but for the money I think it could be more.",1
"My boys love it and play it as often as I'll let them. I rated it for 4+ just because of control issues for being able to play by yourself, but if your kids are more apt at computers than mine were than they'll be able to play younger than mine.
My kids favorite game right now is the calendar game to put together.",1
"We've used a lot of the jump start products so we were very excited to find jumpstart online. My 5 year old son LOVES this game and loves running around the world doing the various activities, buying things to ride on, jumping from free fall mountain, etc. However, I am just not that impressed with the educational value of this game. I read several reviews before showing him the game that talked about how educational it is and how it could even be your child's homework. Huh? Almost all of the games I have seen are mostly platform run and jumping type of games and the few educational games that I've seen were not very good.
For fun factor, I'd give this game an A, but as far as educational is concerned, I give it a C-.",1
The game is very dark and has minimal blood but the only real reason not to let your kids play it is they may break your TV when they throw the controller at the screen. I have played 3 hours and have not beaten the first level.,0
"Demon's souls, as fearsome-sounding a name it is for a video game, fits it rather well. This will probably be the hardest video game you have ever played if you have joined the gaming horde in recent years, and you will be tested brutally. This is the game to hand your friend at a party whilst they boast about their immense video-gaming prowess; you can expect their attitude to quickly change when Demon's Souls is brought up. You will be humiliated by death constantly, and almost every time, you will lose your souls (experience for leveling up your character) and placement in the area. That said, when you die, you go back to the start. Thankfully Demon's souls has mercy in the fact that it is very coherent, and you can understand why you die in almost every situation. It is all up to a player to throw the nails in their coffin. When you start out in the game I can near guarantee you that you or the one you buy the game for will die again and again. It will be frustrating experience, at first.
Then the player realizes, once their personal skill rises, that this is one of the most satisfying video games they have ever played. Every act you do is so soul-crushingly hard that if you are successful, the feeling of payoff is like no other in any game in recent memory.
Past the game itself, it also has some overtones and messages that, if the gamer is unprepared, could actually infringe on their mental health. The world is incredibly dark. Not like a ""shoot em up extreme"" dark, but more like a ""you have no hope"" dark. You character is surrounded by disgusting half-humans, killer beasts, and things so horrifying they would be hard to describe in words. Demon's souls can ""grip"" a person in this manner, up to the point where it can infringe on the player's mental health. So if you or your kid plays this game be sure to have them take breaks often.",0
"We just got this game yesterday along with Wii Sports Resort, me and my dad have played for an hour so far. The trainer is good role model because he or she(depends on if you choose a male or a female trainer) encourages you to do yoga and strength training everyday to improve your posture and stretch your muscles! You can also weigh dogs and cats! Our dog Tiffany apparently weighs 26 pounds! One thing me and my dad don't like about this game is that it uses the BMI system and they don't take your muscle mass into account when weighing you, so my dad who has a lot of muscle gets incorrectly weighed as obese when he is just a bit overweight( he just has a big round stomach he needs to get rid of). Other then that, the game gets you up and moving and is fun for the whole family, it even gets my 44 year old dad to get up and move and have fun while doing it!
NOTE: children under 3 can't play this game, you can only weigh them. Consult the manual for details!",1
"Tonnes of fun for everyone. Some of the activities are too challenging for younger children, but there is still enough to keep our 4 year old entertained.
One big improvement over the Wii Fit is the ability to switch players without having to go all the way back to the main menu. This change makes it far more group friendly.",1
i love this game! I play it with my 10 year old daughter all the time.,1
"Just got it a week ago. Great to play with my 10 year old and he likes playing it as much as any other video game. The difference between him lounging in the couch and playing animal crossing (for example) vs. up on his feet trying to ski jump, balance, run, step, do a yoga pose is phenomenal. The extra training plus games that are new with this version (fit plus) are the ones he particularly likes I wish there were more good games that required standing up and moving. Actually, I also wish there were more levels to unlock on this game,",1
"This is an incredible program! My wife and I have been using the wii fit for a number of months now, and recently picked up the wii fit plus. Over the past few months we have both lost aprox. 20 lbs with the wii fit/wii fit plus, and are both feeling WAY more in shape. Of course this requires being disciplined, and doing a daily body test (even if you don't do the activities, it helps to simply be aware of where your weight is every day... it makes you think twice about sitting around and snacking). So all in all, it is a great investment if you want something to help you achieve your weight goals.",1
FIFA 10 is a soccer sim. Right? The violence only involves slide tackles. Which normally either take the player down or get the ball. This is rated 8+ by me because of the difficulty. Not the content. Common sense say Iffy for 8+ honestly? Slide tackling is not appropiate for 8 year olds? I was playing GTA when I was 8. This is appropiate for anyone who can play it.,1
"This was fun for the whole family and the adults loved it better than plain Rock Band because the songs were more familiar. A few songs contained curse words, which was surprising for a Lego product which would presumably be targeted at children. Lots of levels of difficulty make it a challenge for all ages but the ""no fail"" setting keeps younger players from getting frustrated. My kids enjoyed personalizing their Lego people and instruments and spending the ""studs"" they earned at ""gigs"" to buy extras as much as they did playing. If I could own only 1 version of Rock Band, this would be it!",1
The lovable Lego franchise meets the Rock Band interface in a game the kids love but I find a bit blah in terms of song choice. Humor abounds but I wish there was more Lego-like construction playability.,1
"Best Xmas holiday yet. We played it nonstop with 4-10 year olds, and even after the kids went to sleep. A total hoot.",1
"This is a great game! As others have said, it is easy for 5 year old to play and challenging for my 9 year old (and me!). We all really enjoy it, and it certainly teaches about rhythm. Yes, there are a few songs with lyrics that are questionable, but we are concentrating so hard on playing that we haven't even noticed.",1
"This game is a LOT of fun. As a dumbed down version of Rock Band this gives the family fun to all skill levels. While there is a bit of competition the lack of fail and turning off the kick drum makes it a LOT of simple fun. While there can be some issues with lyrics especially if you access downloadable content from other Rock Band games, it's no worse than what is on the radio.",1
"My 6 year old boy loves it. It has a ""Super Easy"" mode where the kids can just strum the guitar. I chose the educational highlight because it can teach the kids rhythm and basic drums. Real instruments and music lessons are better but this is a good introduction to playing music. Since I have to musical talent it is nice ""jamming"" with my son even though it is with plastic instruments.",1
My 6 year old daughter loved playing the drums on super easy mode. We got to spend some good quality family time together. With other rock bands she would get too frustrated and we would have to quit. Today we played through 7 straight songs before we had to quit for dinner.,1
"Great for kids, will need help though if they are young to understand the star count and how to unlock new animals. A little bit pricey but worth it if your kids love animals, and even better if they are girls.",1
Both my 5 &amp; 7 year old love this game! It's fun to play with the animals and earn points to get more animals. Shows you have to play AND clean up after them,1
"Our whole family enjoys this game. I wouldn't mind fewer steps to get to the point, while the reading parts are great to encourage kids to read-it gets tedious when the characters have cycled through a few times. Nintendo also needs to give players the option to be either sex and shop for clothes for either sex. Our son likes the game, but doesn't want his character to be a girl.",1
"My daughter loves this game! It did take her a little time to learn how to move Dora, but now she can make her run, walk, and jump. She loves to make Boots jump into the bushes and barrels to explore. She really enjoys ""finding"" all of the pages to the books and the crystals. I love that it has the help feature where I can take control when she needs the extra little help and also there is a helping Fairy that gives instructions and advice. I like that the assist mode can be turned off for older children!",1
A good game for preschoolers to learn a game controller. Lots different arm actions with the Wii remote to move Dora along. Additional help narration for new users is good. This help can be skipped individually or turned off the the whole game.,1
This game is a clear winner and it is such a great experience thank you so much.,1
"the wrist action of turning the controller in a circle,left to right or back can`t take longer than a few seconds or it will cause the player to shut off the game!I was trying out the game on the wii this a.m., and found it irritating at first because the background music can`t be shut off or lowered. Then, I found Dora was hard to understand. Helpful was the ""fairies' who showed up to tell me what to do next .",1
Fun and easy to play. I really like the graphics and characters.,1
"We bought this for our daughter after much reviewing on various websites, and we haven't regretted it. She loves the game, which teaches her patience, allows her to grow food and raise animals, and also allows her to enter her plants and animals in the in-game festivals. This game does also allow the player to ""woo"" and marry NPCs (computer characters) and have and raise children. There is an excellent work/reward system woven in, letting the player expand their homes, earn prizes and money, and have a happy family. Mature 8 year olds should be able to handle the need for patience and follow the directions to accomplish their goals.",1
"As soon as your kid can read, have them play this game!
This game is wonderful and one of my favorites. I'm 18 and I play it constantly, but maybe I'm just a kid at heart. It's truly an all ages enjoyable game. The characters and role models are excellent. The whole point of the game is to make friends, help your friends, and help your neighbors while building a successful life on the farm. It helps kids learn to take proper care of animals and cultivate crops, and learn about how things grow. There are a lot of very joyful things there too because the circus is really fun to watch and animals are fun to interact with. A must have for kids that love animals.
Also getting married and having kids is very fun and kid friendly. When you're married, your husband or wife will ask if you want to have a child, and then will say ""Okay, we'll go pray to the Harvest Goddess for a baby!"" After a few weeks you'll go to the hospital and get your child.",1
Great game with some puzzle solving. It's just great I don't even need to say much. Just buy it.,1
"This is a nice game. I've had it for two years and still play it to this day! The story is perfect, and the fact that the leading female in the game joins you to help save the world is an added bonus. I have seen countless games where Buff, invincible Men wielded huge guns and swords and slew thousands of enemies in a blaze of gunfire or swings. Zelda, the series' lead female character, breaks this mold and fights with you to help out! Use your sword, Boomerang, and other weapons to bring justice to a world threatened by darkness! Are you alone? No. You're some kid with a cool train and a nice girl by your side. Score one for Nintendo. Keep it up, guys.",1
My son has really enjoyed playing this game. He received it for Christmas along with the book. It is nice that we can give him 30 minutes of video game time and he can accomplish a task and save. Other games are much more involved and complicated that we can not work them into a reward system. He has really enjoyed the challenge of the tasks in this game.,1
"I found the DS Zelda titles rather disapointing-the stylus is at best, an imperfect tool, and gets worse on a DS that's seen use. Also, the DS titles brag having multiple commands for the map and such, but you can't play without a stylus. In any case, it's good for what it is-but not up to snuff compared with Zelda's comsole titles.",1
"There is nothing wrong with the game (except a sprinkle of violence), but its a pain in the rear to find online. We spent about 6 weeks trying to find this. And it was worth it.",1
Talking to your child(children) about fantesy and reality is important. I think they need to know what is safe and unsafe. My son is 7 and he gets it. We love to play these games. And when my grandsons play the game; we discuss the values of the game. We all have enjoyed it.,1
"Better than the original! It's educational, (because of the real types of fish and aquatic life.) And you do get attacked by sharks, but instead of shooting them with a gun, you shoot them with something that calms it down.",1
The music is so soothing &amp; calm! I actually love it when my son plays this game!,1
"My 6 y.o. son and I have had a great time playing this together. Basically I operate the keyboard and mouse and we figure out how to solve the puzzles together. It's funny, clever, challenging at times, but it's overall great fun and been a nice activity for the two of us to do together for 30 min in the evenings. Between the accents and the ""Briticisms"" it's sometimes a little hard to follow the dialogue, but it gets easier with time.",1
"Ok, so... I work in the game industry... and I'm female... and this has to be the most condescending and sexist piece of garbage I have ever seen. There is making games for kids, and then there is making utter garbage, and this is just complete garbage.
First off, if you have to differentiate between ""boys"" games and ""girls"" games, I have news for you; your method of thinking is so outdated that your brain is probably collecting dust. Sure, there are some good facts in the game, but your kid is better served just reading a textbook and learning these facts because the game is basically that, a freaking textbook. It is just as engaging, and your kid will find it just as boring... as a freaking textbook... the antithesis of ""game"".
A good ""educational"" and ""empowering"" game both serves to entertain as well as inform. A good educational game doesn't spoonfeed facts, it provides example. It serves to teach tangentally. A good educational game IS. NOT. THIS. GAME.
There is a reason why ""girls"" products are nearly universally reviled, and it is because garbage like this exists. This game is not ""empowering"". It is just fluff wrapped in random facts, gift-wrapped by clueless old men who rushed a product out the door in the hopes of making a quick buck.
Do. Not. Buy. This. Garbage.",0
My son LOVES this! He loves to show his friends how to play as well.,1
"In my opinion, most games that are based on movies aren't really up my ally. But this game, OH MY GOSH! It is truly a fantastically amazing game! There's so much to do in it! You can play the story mode, which is based on the movie, or you can do the amazing toy box mode, where you can customize buildings and people! Also, the game has such a huge variety of game styles, like racing, shooting, world making, platform jumping, and so much more! This game, however, can be intense and a little frightening. The explosions and ground-pounding sounds feel and look real. The game is more intense when Buzz Lightyear shoots alien robots in an outer space setting, and that is like the best part throughout the game! I'm not gonna lie: this game is really fun and exciting! It is totally worth playing! TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!",1
"Kids play this all the time..and they said they had to play for a while to get it, but now they understand it.good game..",1
"TOY STORY 3 combines everything that makes all family-oriented video games good and puts it all together. It is fun, engaging, action-packed, educational, and positive. It lets you play levels with storylines, or just roam around and let your imagination run loose while creating an old-Western town. As Sheriff of Woody's Roundup, you can build, run, drive, ride, and destroy (though not violently) as much as you want. You help your friends through ""missions"" that they give you while you jail outlaws and strive to build the best town you can. I guess if there was to be an innapropriate thing in this game, it would be the brief violent content. You do get to shoot whatever you want with wands, laser pistols, etc. However, robots/boxes are the only things that explode or die (and they just puff up at that). The only thing that would make this game unsuitable for younger kids (aged 6-8) is the challenging nature of some of the levels. Especially for kids who don't play many video games, the controls might be a little overwhelming at first. However, the game always points you in the right direction, giving you an optional ""compass"" feature that tells you where to go, or sometimes even showing you what to do if you ask.",1
"My 7-year-old and 5-year old LOVE this game and can't get enough of it. They play it separately together enjoy helping each other in both the one-player and two-player mode. I dislike that they are encouraged to kick toys in the Toy Box mode, but we discussed it, and that action has not manifested itself in their real playroom. I love watching them play it, and the mini-movies are highly amusing for all ages!",1
"My girls love this game. It was very easy to pick up and start playing and they are now hooked. The quests are somewhat easy at first, but get progressively harder as you go along, which is a good thing. If you don't want a challenge, just take your time and fly around the beautiful island. Highly recommend this game for all those junior (and senior) pilots out there.",1
"Big big story in which the character, or hero,'s only objective is being nice to others to improve the states of the game's setting. The scope of the game means this morality can be disected into the smallest details of kindness the material of story-based video game code is able to translate.",1
This game is safe and reliable. You don't have to worry about your kids getting hurt. My daughter got her game yesterday and hasn't wanted to stop. The game can also transfer coins to your kids' actual accounts on Club Penguin. It's a fun game that the whole family can play.,1
My 9 year old loves it perfect for almost any age!,1
"Civilization V is a stunningly enjoyable game which has the potential to inspire people of all ages to learn more about history. Although it does not present an accurate portrayal of historical events (as it allows each player to choose their own path), it presents the course of human history and civilization as a fascinating journey. Even more importantly, the emphasis it places on long-term strategic thinking and planning promotes strong development of decision-making and reasoning skills.
Although the game does not present a specific sense of morality, this ambiguity allows players to think intelligently about the choices they make and the real impact those choices will have on their virtual subjects. This might be lost on younger players, but it's a great idea to talk about this with older, thoughtful children.
In many senses, this game is a lot like chess for the twenty-first century. People play it as entertainment, not to learn, but while playing Civilization V, learning is almost unavoidable, even if you don't notice because you're having too much fun.
Although I rated the game as being appropriate for anybody over the age of 8, that's a reference to the content, not the difficulty. Even on the easiest setting, the game will most likely be too difficult for most children under the age of twelve or so, unless an older player helps them as they learn the game.
The game can be violent in a sense, but roughly in the same sense that chess is violent: in chess, you move pieces from one tile to another on the game board, taking over the territory that your opponent's pieces once occupied. Although the combat in Civilization V is dressed up with fancier graphics and some sound effects, it's relatively abstract like chess, as though you're moving a token on a game board.
In summation, Civilization V is loads of fun, and also a genuinely positive experience, challenging players to engage in creative planning, weighing priorities, calculating risks, adapting to changing scenarios, and considering the morality of their actions. I have been playing the Civilization series of computer games since I was a child, and it took me decades to realize just how much I was learning from it. The beauty is, you don't learn facts - you learn how to *think*, and that's the most important type of learning there is.",1
"Not the best Sid Meier game, but certainly not bad, its new tile system is a great improvement, but it can tend to be very all-or-nothing and get boring, especially in the later game. Strategy can also be very cheesy.",1
"Civilization V is a great game with massive content. Since it is a turn based strategy game there will be some combat, but it is not detailed. The game is more focused on civilization and army management as well as political and trade dealings. There are references to wine and tobacco, but no shown consumption.",1
"Civilization V, much like many games of today, has benefited immensely from the improvements the add-ons have provided. With Gods &amp; Kings and Brave New World, the game is much more challenging and now provides the player with several different paths to choose from. Gratis Games The map packs are, I would argue, a little redundant with all the user made mods and map packs out there, but all in all, the complete edition is a great game that will indeed keep you clicking the Just one more turn-button!",1
My kids really enjoy playing Civilization V and we also play multiplayer together.,1
"My girls and I LOVE this game. Even my wife, who is not a gamer at all, loves to join in. Get it today!",1
"Kirby’s Epic Yarn is a creative and original platformer safe for anyone old enough to be able to understand how to play. The youngest players might become a little afraid while facing off against some of the game’s larger monsters, but it’s not exactly the stuff of nightmares -- all of the game’s enemies are made of yarn. Plus, they cannot kill the game’s little pink hero, only make him lose some of the beads he’s collected. Note, though, that some parts of the game are quite challenging, and that younger children will likely require the help of an older sibling or parent to complete them. Recommended for ages 3-8 years",1
"We LOVED IT !!!! My daughter of 5 loved this game (we just rented it). It's cute and not scary at all. I highly recommend to all parents of little ones that likes fun games (it can be a challenge at beginning, though).",1
"I wasn't sure about this game until my boys played it at the store and loved it. The two boys play together and it forces them to cooperate. I love how the characters never ""die"" and so there is no frustrtation on that end. The 5 year old does, however, need some help on some of the levels, they can get tricky.",1
"My 5 year old son and I have been playing this game everyday since I picked 4 days ago. It is really fun, and the best part of all....is a good work out! If you want to keep your kids (and yourself) moving while playing something fun...then this is your game. Be prepared with a glass of water near by, and to take a shower after the game. My son and I certainly worked up a sweat!
The Adventure hunt part of the game is great for multi players. There were some tasks that we had a hard time doing as a team, so after we tried a couple of times...if we couldn't do them with two players, then we just opted to play that task with one play (sometime it was my 5 year old instead of me as he has faster feet :)). Once that task was completed, then we went back to playing together. I found this extremely helpful.
My son also likes playing the Free Play mode on his own. He can play the mini-games he likes over and over, and also at different skill levels. Keeps him challanged, and interested...and IN SHAPE!
Great game. Thanks for the recommendation. I only purchased it based on the reviews it received.",1
Kids are truly active and having fun! A great combination.,1
"Me and my son have been waiting for this ever since we saw the signs. It was just as satisfying as the other games in the series. The content is mild, you may come across a cuss word or two, but nothing is stronger than b*stard. It is a bit pricey though, with the gutair, drums, and microphone to buy.",1
"I bought this game recently for a long car trip, and I, as a 14-year-old that it is EPIC (in my own way)!!! I still play on the Metallic Rose-colored Nintendo DS Lite that my mom bought for me at the local Walmart the day after I got out of the sixth grade, so I don't have the ability of the camera that is included in the DSi/XL/3DS, but it's not the end of the world. (I honestly don't care). I like the fact that you can use the free paint and create whatever you feel like, but the only disadvantage is that once you switch from pencil to paints, you CANNOT switch back to pencil (which is a piece of advice for people who are complaining that they can't swich back to pencil once they go to paint without starting over or saving the current painting. But, I've done the same thing in art class). And, this would make an excelent Wii game. MY FAVORITE!!!",1
My 10 year old loves playing this game and has picked up many great tips she now uses in her own art.,1
"I am 19 and thought the images of the ghost girlk were way too scary. I like my nanayc drew games because they are generally light and fun and im playing it at 11:00 at night alone while everyone else is asleep, and this creepy ghost girl who resembles the girl from the grudge charges at me while croaking. i did not like that. the rest of the game is good but I did not think this was appropriate for a game supposedly intended for 10 year olds. If i wanted to be disturbed by my game, I would play an Adventure Company Jack the Ripper game or something.",0
"Good game for older teens and adults but some of the songs, dances, and clips from the show are too suggestive or racy for younger kids. There are some words that are deleted from the lyrics but others that are just as or more objectionable left it.
While there are several difficulty levels, the complete lack of instructions at times makes the game more difficult that it should be. It almost seems like they rushed to get the game on the shelves instead of taking time to write the manual. There is nothing to explain the difference in the various types of play (shooting star vs co-op vs duet vs scrapbook). This lack of clear directions makes the actual game play less fun than it should be. I notice the Vol. 2 review here on CSM indicates it features a ""new"" shooting star mode. Vol. 1 also has shooting star mode, which we only realized when the younger child was goofing around with the wii remote while waiting for his turn. How would anyone know? There's nothing anywhere that explains what it is or what to do in that mode.
The duet mode is fun and challenging as you actually have to hit harmonies to get a good score, but unfortunately not all the songs have duet mode as an option.
If all you want to do is plug in a microphone and sing, you probably won't care about these shortcomings. My husband &amp; I do find Glee Karaoke more enjoyable than RockBand because we actually know all of the songs on GK vs RB which has lots of obscure artists.",0
"Max Payne 3 is indisputably one of my son's favorite games. He talks about it constantly and in a positive manner. I bought the game for him when he was 13 and I watched him play through the game in its entirety, much to his irritation. The game itself features quite realistic and, at times, brutal violence, but if your teen and yourself as a parent are okay with violence, this isn't too much of an issue. Sexual content is featured in this title, however, no full nudity is presented to the player, and a large number of the encounters in cut-scenes have the option to be skipped. For example, when the main protagonist, Max, meets a friend at a brothel, and sexual acts are present in the background. My son is, in my opinion mature for his age and handles these topics well. It really depends on how your child will react to this game, but anywhere from 13 above is suitable.",0
"A mature teen would have a very good time playing this. Since there is nudity and lots of cussing, it is not appropriate for younger audiences.",0
"Max Payne 3 is a lot different than the other Max Payne games, especially with Max's character development. Dealing with the depression of losing his wife and daughter, the game focuses on Max's addiction to painkillers and alcohol with many depressing overtones.
Outside of the cutscenes of Max boozing and pill popping, the game's combat is pretty brutal. The game has over-the-top elements such as bullet time and slow motion shootdodging, but when the game goes into it's kill cam mode the enemy can be shown with the bullets hitting them very realistically with blood spurting out of the holes in their body after they are dead.
As for language, this being a Rockstar game, the game is filled with tons of F-bombs being used by every character in the game.
Sex and nudity is frequent, especially in one level where Max walks into a bar/club in South America and the camera pans in ways to show people engaging in sexual activities with prostitutes, breasts and butts being visible.",0
"Max Payne 3 is very well written, but it is made by Rockstar, so it will be edgy. The game is very violent and bloody, and the whole game revolves around a hostage situation. Max Payne is given the job of a body gaurd for a wealthy family in Brazil. That being said, the wife of the noble man is kidnapped and taken hostage, and the game follows Max's journey to rescue her. Max is a decent role model as he is trying to do his job and bring the girl back alive. The violence in the game is very graphic. You can shoot civilians in the crossfire without consequences. You will see extreme blood splatter and blood pools from dead bodies, complete with bloody bullet holes. The most violent scenes are in cutscenes: the first is where you see a man with his arm severed after an explosion, and the other is when a man sacrifices himself and suicide bombs a group of enemies, in which after you will see bloody, dimembered bodies and gore. There is some strong sexual content in the game as one mission has Max visiting a brothel to meet with a cop. In this mission, players will see people having sex in the background, complete with thrusting and full bottomless nudity. There is also a nude striper. Language is very strong with the use of every word in the book. Overall, if your 16 year old wants a fun game with a very outstanding story, than Max Payne 3 is a good choice.",0
"Good, non-stop action single player, the multiplayer is also great. If you like the Die Hard movies, you'll enjoy this game.
Contains graphic violence and very strong language.",0
"Serious privacy and safety concerns: This is the first game in the series to include multiplayer support, so gamers can play against one another online -- and if desired, chat with one another openly via headset microphone in an un-moderated and un-monitored setting.
Really Common Sense? Just because you can interact with people online doesn't automatically mean you're going to come in contact with, let's say ""bad"", people.
Overall, this game is very entertaining but due to the violent, sexual, and profane content, should not be played by anyone under 17.",0
"This game isn't for anyone who has a hard time with the macabre or some of the darkest themes of life. However, as someone with Bipolar disorder, this game was hands-on therapy for me regarding reaction to triggering stresses. In the game, if you seek pure revenge in the form of killing, your world becomes darker (as mentioned in the game) but you also lose friends and never gain new ones. These are the elements of the game that I think makes it a worthwhile journey for people who need to practice being smart instead of emotional, because the real-world lessons are there without the real-world consequences.",0
"Dishonored is a game where you take the role of a brutal assassin. What if I told you that you could do all that without killing a soul? In the game, you play as Corvo, an assassin with only one task. To save the Empresses daughter. IF that's not a great role model I don't know what is. This game wants to stop you from killing! If you kill the get a terrible ending to an amazing game. Anyways my 13-year-old son wanted this game. In case you can not guess my family in Christian. At first, I was very worried but when I researched I was surprised at how amazing this game looked. My son has watched Passion of the Christ so I knew he could handle the violence but the assassin part pulled me away. Then, I learned the game does not want you to kill but to save. You use your superhuman powers to save and a young girl named Emily and to avenge the death of the Queen. If you are Christian and have a child who wants this game please let them get it. It taught my soon to make deep moral choices and had him faced with murder or mercy. In the end, 85% of players will play this game Non-lethal and save the day. I hope this review helped and God bless!",0
"So I've played this through twice now. It is a great game and there is a lot of replay value. If the concern lies somewhere other than age appropriateness then dont worry. As far as the age goes because of the violence I would not suggest it to children under the age of 16. There are points where you can decapitate some one and carry their head. As one other reviewer pointed out swarms of rats do graphically devour npcs. There is a level that takes place in a brothel. Your character can not interact with any of the women aside from talking. Although you do not have to kill anyone killing is a big part of the game. You can kill the enemies but also the bystanders (e.g. the women in the brothel). DLC and side quests dont give the option of not killing. So It is one of my favorite games, but not for under 16 i would say 14 would be pushing it.",0
"If your kid dosen't like blood or just you don't want him to see anything very gruesome don't let him play. In this game you can cut of arms heads legs and even people in to tiny bits, rats in the game devour dead bodies whole (yes even the bone) other wise it a great game really fun you can choose to be stealth and not kill anyone but it's kinda hard to not be noticed the only difference is the good and bad ending and the number of rats and weepers (weepers are weird zombie like people with the plauge, they night your arms and spit strange stuff on you) if you don't care what gruesome things you'll let your kid see it's fine other than one mission you'll go to a strip club but nothing is shown other than girls in brothels though they do talk about whores and there is an option to look through a keyhole and see a girl bathing but no nudity is shown",0
"Dishonored is a fantasy video game. It has violent moments about the same as Skyrim. I think that if you have Skyrim this is okay for them. It has guns, but not that bad. It is a very good game.",0
"To clarify, at no point does the game tell the player ""it is wrong to kill people"". When other reviews say it discourages killing, what they really mean is that killing people will change the way the story progresses. There is no immediate benefit in choosing to avoid someone over choosing to kill them, the latter often being easier.
Next, in terms of violence, a lot of these reviews are off. Yes, you get the ""splash of blood"" as some people are saying. However, you can also watch corpses get devoured into nothing by swarms of rats, giving enough time to clearly see a body with all the organs exposed. The game is centered around plague, and your character even has the power to summon rats to kill enemies.
Besides all of that, the theme of the game is, simply, revenge. While you can indirectly help others, your motivation through the whole story is to kill off anyone that betrayed you and anyone that might be helping them. It's an excellent story to follow, but you're not going to learn a lot of virtues from this one.",0
dishonored Is a mature game that should not be played by kids. if you are stealthy than the game is far less violent but if you kill everybody it gets pretty bloody. if your kids mature and can take some blood I might be ok but for the most part this game should not be played by kids.,0
this is a good game though it does consist of some content that might not be appropriate for everyone. as long as you choose to play it stealthy the violence really shouldn't b a problem.,0
"It is a very good game, that has a lot of history teaching behind it. You do play as an assassin but his goals are not killing innocent people, more of killing important people in the British Army during the American Revolution. There is little swearing, as it takes place in a time when people had more decency than to talk with profanity. There is alcohol and smoking, but its visible in numerous taverns and inns in the game's world. The violence is visible in the many battle scenes in the game. I say anyone under 12 shouldn't play.",0
"Swearing is my biggest concern. f*** and s*** and gd is used rarely but still is along with other mild language like hell. Beside violence, (Which might be intense for small kids), it's not bad.",0
"Assassin's Creed III is based in the Revolutionary War. The Profanity consists of all curse words used frequently. The games main weapon is a tomahawk ( may give idea of violence), you can kill by hanging, strangling, stabbing, and slashing. Blood is shown all over enemy clothes and there is alot of violence (cleaner through shoulder, very bloody scenes, hanging). Use of alcohol is frequent and sexual content is medium (sticking face in breasts, women in underwear).",0
Anyone can get it. It is the best game ever.,1
"This game is a first person shooter but more towards the kid friendlier shooters. I will be running through the factors in this game. Just as a heads up this will definitely expand your kids mind, make them think what is out there.
Violence: This game is violent, you shoot aliens and robots called the Promethians with sci-fi guns, only the Covenant (The alien race) will bleed almost unnoticeable paint like blood, your character almost never bleeds, and when he does it is almost nonexistent. There is one cutscene of scientists being disintegrated layer by layer but it is very brief, and if your kid has seen body books showing the layers of a human, this will not be a problem whatsoever. There is a thing called an assassination, you sneak up behind an enemy and hold melee and you will either stab them on snap their neck, you will almost never be able to see the knife, so it seems as of you are just punching them. You can also run into enemy with vehicles this game has no gore at all, even in explosions. Multiplayer is different, you fight human enemies and killing them results in little to no blood, and most of the time when you or another are hit your shield (Pretty much an extra layer of protection over armor) will react seeming to surround the player in lightning.
Language: You may hear D*mn H*ll B*stard and a*s
Sex: Your AI companion is much more sexualized than previous games, she is blue, with black lines covering anything sense however if you let your kid go to the beach, the sexuality in this game is not a factor.
Online Play: Yes, you can play online but have to option to mute chat, if your kid keeps the chat on you may want to talk to them about
cyber bullying.
Overall, Halo is a very fun and appropriate game for kids and your kid will be very lucky to play this game. And if your kid has seen ANY Marvel movies this is an outstanding pick for them.",0
This is the best halo game probably the most violent one though. I think your your child should be 12 to be able to play.,0
This is a great game. Good for kids because batman never kills people. Still it is pretty violent. (no gore at all).,0
"Off the bat, The Walking Dead is a phenomenal game and should be enjoyed by anyone that is a part of the medium. The story is expertly written with moments of both joy and heart wrenching despair. However, this is not a game intended for children. Violence, for instance, while being rare (the main focus of the game is delivering narrative) can become quite graphic and brutal, even for seasoned veterans of violent games, there are many occasions where the characters use strong amounts of profanity (f-bombs do come up), there are a few minor occasions of drinking and one instance where a character is drunk, and some small and minor sexual references. However, the main character Lee is a very positive role model. He is a convicted murder, but don't let that throw you off. He readily admits that what he did was wrong and redeems himself by becoming the vigilant protector of his group and often puts himself in harms way to protect the ones he loves. All in all it is a fantastic game and if you feel your child is mature enough to handle it than it is a must buy game.",0
"Not for kids. You do play as a kid through most of this game, but part of the story is that it's sad that your character has to grow up way faster than she normally should have to. I've been all the way through the game, and I don't recall anything overly sexual, but there is violence and gore to the extreme. Not all the gore is person on zombie either. There is plenty of violence from other characters on you and other characters as well.
In the process of this game you will need to kill other people as well as make decisions about who you think should live and die, and the game makes you think about what you've done too. This isn't like a standard first person shoot 'em up. You feel a lot of these deaths, and decisions can come back to haunt you.
There is also a lot of suspense, and hiding, which can be very scary for a younger crowd. Since you are making decisions for the main character, that can be a lot more immersive and stressful than your average movie.
TL;DR- Awesome game, way too gory, stressful, and adult for a younger audience.",0
"Definitely not for kids.
This contains
-Death
-Violence
-Swearing
-Feels
-Drinking
-Jumpscares
-Gore
-Violence
It's a great game.
However, you must be 17+.",0
A lot of violence and killing girls wich are zombies and very strong language . And very gory seens and disturbing conversations.,0
"This game is simply amazing. It is a dark, compelling tale set in a zombie infested state. But this isn't your basic shoot-em-up zombie game, like in Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead. The story takes a darker trail and pulls the emotional plugs of the character. The main character, Lee, is a murder. He is accused of killing the senator who had an affair with Lee's wife. Sure, Lee has a dark past. But after the zombies kicked in, he protected a little girl he found early in the game. If your kids can pick up the undertones of trust and friendship, they should most definitely PLAY THIS GAME.",0
"A voilent game with a little cursing and blood. Teaches kids a few things about survival, and presents the gamers with a positive role model. Lara Croft shows to be strong and the fact that the main character is a woman helped me be alright with my twelve year old son getting the game. If your son is looking for a game, I advise this one.",0
"This is an extremely violent and disturbing game, solidly for adults only.",0
"As you progress, the game gets more actiony/violent. You'll see chambers with dead bodies/body parts. The main character is up againsts this cult that are trying to use her friend as a sacrifice. The people of this cult aren't necessarily bad people, but you will have to kill them to rescue your friend. Also in certain incidents in the game where if you were to screw up, it can end with a brutal death. Though Gory, it is not the most goriest game. It kinda has an over the top feeling to it. Swear words were used, but not frequently. The game has no nudity, but one thing to note is that the main character wears tight pants, (that's about it.) This game is too gruesome for kids!",0
"Just started it. about 1/4 of the way through. Came across 1 f-word. Graphic violence showing up close kills, and a button timed fight sequence that shows you shooting a man in the head - and full detail of him dying. Slight sexual with Lara getting groped at times. Very real and graphic violence over all.",0
"When I was a teen, I absolutely loved the original Tomb Raider series. I still play them from time to time. I played the reboot myself, and I found that it's just far too violent for me. If I, as a grown woman, find myself almost unable to deal with so much graphic violence, there is no way I'd recommend this to my child. For teens younger than 17, use your own discretion I guess. Not a chance that my 12 year old is playing it despite the other reviews here.
I feel that the reboot has alienated fans like myself that don't have such a strong stomach. lol. I won't be replaying it. The storyline was good, gameplay good (apart from the graphicness), the dialogue not so great. Oh and it was full of bad language later on, not so much at the start.",0
Engaging and fun I let my 11 year old play this after months of moaning and then actually realised it portrays the world the way it is unfair and brutal all topics in this game are what my child talks about at school next time he looks at call of duty or battle field he will know that fighting isn't actually fun but brutal and emotionally hard Lara is a great positive role model and the game teaches children a bit about survival and how to stay safe just tone it down to your village or city and they will soon understand why it's better safe than sorry,1
"Not so bad, just if your character dies it shows a violent scene.",0
"Look, the violence, tobacco use and mild swearing are NOT why I believe this game isn't really for kids. Its the themes explored in the game that make me pause whenever I see someone saying how the game isn't really inappropriate. No, the level of violence might not bother some people at all, even if it does get quite bloody with the melee executions at times. This game deals heavily with things like racism, religion and political extremism. If that's not too bad, should you want to play the ""Burial at Sea"" DLC, it gets much MUCH darker, including a chilling torture session of the POV character that actually gave me nightmares! (At 18 years old). Aside from that the plot can be a little confusing occasionally, though it is excellently written.
The story and characters are masterfully presented, the gameplay is excellent, and this is, hands down, one of my favorite games. I believe a parent and a child could learn a lot by discussing some of the things that happen, but only if the child is mature enough to understand what's going on and why. Also Burial at Sea was downright terrifying at some moments. A mature teen should handle it fine, but proceed with caution. Blood and gore are not the only things that can give you nightmares.",0
"Bioshock infinite tackles some complex issues, suchlike religious fanatism and white supremacy, and also the outcome of violent revolution and slave labor, merged in a world of mysticism and prejudice.
-Gory Violence: Blood is expelled from the bodies of enemies, and their heads can be blown or cut off. Civilians can be murdered (at the player's choice).
- Drinking and smoking: The characters can smoke and drink to recover their energy (although they lose their health if they do so).
Some occasional profanities, almost none sexual content.",0
"The story revolves around theoretical meta physical physics that requires a steel comb to understand what's going on. Themes of slavery, racism, supremacy, and radical religion drive the plot. Besides that it's a fun first person shooter.",0
"Cool violent game for older teens and adults.
Intense Violence
Bad Language(sh-t)
Drinking/Smoking
Sexual Themes",0
"The game has a message, and does present issues such as segregation and/or discrimination in light of the setting (1912). However, I wouldn't consider it a game for kids due to the immense amount of violence thrown into the game. While the game does handle issues such as discrimination, the state of America near the turn of the century, and the personal morality of the central characters, the consequences of one's decisions, and so on, the level of violence is a pretty strong drawback. For older teens and adults, it can be incredibly inspiring, but just too violent for kids.
I disagree with the ratings on sexuality. There is a revealing dress that shows cleavage on a main female character, and there are people talking about the cute guys and girls to try dating, but it's generally far more casual and discrete than what most teens are exposed to nowadays. Again, a reflection of culture back in 1912.
The main positive of the game is the focus on how the main characters' decisions and lifestyle affected himself and others around him, and how the consequences are there, a factor that many games don't include to as strong of an extent.
The high level of violence though, makes it a game for mature audiences.",0
"As everyone says, this one packs a lot of violence. I suppose it's ""par"" with other popular games, meaning you'll get blood from bullets and a ""skyhook"" which is used essentially as a chainsaw.
One thing that must be noted about the game is the society that it's set in. Depending on the time in the story, you'll run into a lot of racism or similar themes. How exactly is this expressed? In addition to the general setup of the society (Irish and African citizens live in slums, some are clearly depicted as ""servants""), there are a few instances where the clear point is white supremacy.
The most notable example of this is a ""mixed"" couple being tied on a stage, surrounded by images of gorillas, and a lottery that will allow the winner to throw a baseball at the couple.
If your child won't be bothered with either of these issues, it's a great game. The only other thing to note about the game is that the story might be difficult to follow, as I know some adults that needed to play it a second time before they fully understood what was really going on.",0
"This game is actually toned down from the other Bioshocks. The game has interesting gameplay. The main issue in my opinion would be the violence. There is several weapons which, when shooting enemies, can cause blood to spray. There is some intense scenes, especially one where your character kills a man by smashing his head into a fountain. The game is in the 1912s, and the city you're in is against racism. The game also takes on a large religious portion. One of the main enemies, a man named Father Comstock, claims to be a God-like man, and he worships leaders of America such as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, etc. Most people also believe you are the False Shepard. Your character can eat several things to regain health, and can also drink. I'd say this would be good for a mature teen.",0
"It contains moderate shooter violence. There are occasional gruesome executions seen with a weapon called the skyhook, but that's the only bad content. Elizabeth, the main character, is a kind, thoughtful, well-meaning individual. The other main character, Booker, is a rough and tough anti-hero, but not as mean as other characters.",0
"I've played all the Bioshock games and this one is the least graphic. The ""naked lady"" figure on the bottle that the review talks about is sometimes in piles of junk found throughout the game. These pile don't even occur that often. As for the ""brutal killing"" that it mentions, this doesn't even have that much blood. It's your classic FPS game. the only blood really seen is when you shoot an enemy. This game doesn't curse all that much either. I mean, sure there are a few racial slurs, but it's set in 1912. And the ""sexual language"" is only said one time in the game. I played all the way through this game, and i say that no child younger than 10 or 11 should play this game. I really think that common sense did a horrible job of reviewing this game. In my opinion. As long as your child can handle violence and a little cursing, they can play this.",0
"13+:
Frequent, brutal bloody violence
Frequent profanity
Infrequent sex references",0
"The last of us is not an easy game to review: Joel is trying to protect Ellie in a post pandemic, decimated world, fuelled with mutant creatures and desperate survivers. He is ready to kill unarmed foes, turture then and lie in order to protect the girl. The violence is very strong: In one scene, near the end, a character murders another with a machete (We can hear his face being cut off and lot of blood); in another scene a character comits suicide and there are letters that that make allusions to death children, scenes that make reference to cannibalism, bodies rotting in the street and a lot of scary, stressful, gameplay moments: Low health, low ammo or when your character is being hunt down by the enemy in hard difficulties. But there are some scenes and gameplay moments that reminds the characters that they are still humans: one of the most beautiful scenes in the game is when the characters (After a very stressful sequence) meet some giraffes in a park, and Ellie reminds Joel that after all they been through, it must not have been in vain and that we cannot run away from our past, some times we can just accept it and carry on; besides this, unlike other games, the players are aware that those infected where once humans and that there enemies are doing the same thing that they're: trying to survive, and only kill because they've no choice. Very strong profanities through the entire game, blood can be turned off (For gameplay sequences).",0
"mild blood, guns, swearing, and politics. Adding this rating in preparation for the VR game",0
"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist is NOT a game for kids or young teens. I started playing solo when I was about 17, but had played it before with my dad. This game is very violent and is full of profanity, with the main characters and even enemies dropping the f bomb several times in the opening missions, but calms down a lot after that. When you shoot enemies, they groan in pain with an ""Aaah"" upon death. While there are ways to non lethally subdue enemies, killing them is usually the only way to get rid of them or to advance. With blood flying, necks snapping, and even an on screen electrocution torture scene, this game is not for the faint of heart. If you have kids, make sure they can't hear the game.",0
"The game is based on the stealth shadow genre so you are mainly taking out people in the shadows so you cant see it. So blood and gore are useless to complain about. Language is strong but if your child like my child plays games like call of duty, batman arkham I guess he or she is allowed. Please learn something from this because I am also an expireced player",0
Not suggested for kids under the age of 15 the reason is intense violence and continues use of words like f++k and sh+t.,0
"This game isn't as bad as you may think it is. Sure its rated for different things such as blood, language, and violence. The blood isn't that bad. Its really not anything different from one of Halo games or Assassin's Creed games, which if you don't already know, isn't very much at ALL. Next, the language. The language is a little bit bad, but if your kid knows the words, then it should be fine. Some of the words I've heard are like F**k, S**t, and the occasional a*****e, other than that its completely fine. I've played through the entire game about 3 times or so, and I've heard minimal language. In each mission, I might hear about 2-3 F bombs, but that's it, so its not all that bad. Lastly the violence parts of this game, the violence in this game is very minimal. Sure there is shooting and stuff, but its not anything worse than a rated T game. But all of the stabbing could be a problem. But if your kid plays stuff like Assassins creed where your shoving a sword into someones face, this is completely fine. There a a few ""stealth action"" parts in the game that may include choking and stuff, but its not all that bad. In my opinion, its similar to a regular fighting game. All in all, this is a very good game and I think that it is appropriate for any kid 11 and up.",0
I think this game is a great game with some language that may pop up twice or three times in the game. There is some violence that contains a lot of blood but it isn't like any other Splinter Cell game where you can choose good or bad sides to slit throats but you can interrogate terrorists that try to kill you which can be considered brutal. So there is a slight positive message from Sam Fisher that shows you that he interrogates only in self defense. Children should know that violence in the real world is wrong and they should only protect themselves from getting hurt and that they shouldn't cause any violent acts. This game is pretty good for mature teenagers around 14-15 years and up.,0
"It called Assassins Creed so right there its violent becuase its about you assassnating people. People who say its good for history are onlly half true ""its inspired by history but 99% of its fictional blood can be disabled but can easily be enabled again by a kid it also has swearing and other stuff if your old enough its worth playing",0
"I agree with the review that thought it was OK for a 13-year-old.
This is a fascinating game with plenty of violence and gore, but as you've read, you can turn the blood off. There are several moral judgments, which are interesting, but mostly, you sail around and attack ships and look for stuff on the islands.
I'm not great at video games, and leveling up is pretty easy with AC4. My son has had it for years and I'm only sorry I didn't try it out sooner!
And this does not glorify being a pirate, IMHO. It just gives a glimpse into pirate's life and challenges you to figure out a variety of puzzle situations. Really, really enjoying it.",0
"I just recently got this game on PlayStation 3 and LOVE it so far. Yes its very very violent and there's quite a bit of blood but that's about it. Language is pretty infrequent but its there and it's pretty strong (f--k, s--t, b---h, etc.). And despite the mature rating I think it should be ok for most teens especially if they have played the other Assassin's Creed games.",0
"Resident Evil 2 is the 2019 remake of the classic PS1 horror game from the late 90's. You follow two survivors, rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, sister of the original game's Chris Redfield as they search the amazingly claustrophobic Racoon City to discover the truth as to why the local populace have turned into the flesh-devouring undead and other more dangerous monsters.
Firstly, by survival-horror game standards especially, the gameplay is outstanding. The inventory system is designed in a way where it doesn't feel unfairly restricted, but what happens to you will be your fault if you don't manage your inventory (weapons, ammunition, healing items, key items, crafting items etc.) carefully. The A.I. of the zombies is quite possibly the best zombie A.I. to date, while slow and shambling akin to more classic, George A. Romero-esque zombies, they are still very much a threat and can put you down as quicker as the more threatening monsters if you are not protecting your very limited health carefully. Lickers are fairly easy to deal with under beginning circumstances, just walk past them slowly and they will not acknowledge your presence, but sometimes being attacked by one is unavoidable is other enemy types are present and trying to attack you.
When Mr. X (the Tryant bio-weapon) shows up the tension rises exponentially as he chases you through the hallways of the police station while you try and complete other objectives. Engaging him is futile unless you have no other option as the best you'll do is slow him down, though he is less of an issue in Claire's scenarios as he is not present for anywhere as much time as he is in Leon's.
I mentioned the RE Engine before as being stunning and it is. The environments and particularly the character models are rendered with unbelievable detail and with that detail comes my next point; the gore. This the most detailed gore systen I've ever seen bar the Mortal Kombat franchise, not only can limbs be dismembered or blown up, but there are different levels of injury (clothes, skin, muscle and finally bone) which can lead to all manner of grusome looking wounds. The dismemberment looks extremely real as arms can hang off a zombie for a second or two before the rest of the flesh tears and the limb falls to the ground. Hit one in the right place around the stomach and it will split in half with it's guts and entrails flailing behind it as the it will then proceed to crawl towards you. Making the head explode is the only way to truly put one down as these zombies are the definition of bullet sponges, you can knock them down, even shoot them in the head, but unless that is completely destroyed, it's getting back up.
Not much in the ways of language, a few f--ks and s--ts here and there, but it's not massively strong.",0
"The game is a great horror game, with a mix of dread and fear. Unless your kid is capable of scares, i'd wait until they are 15.",0
"Language: Some Strong
Sex: Mild
Violence: Strong, Blood and Gore
Other: Strong Horror",0
"Great game, but only for strong stomached people. Wow, there's a lot of blood in this game. You can shoot off specific limbs/body parts with fairly detailed gore and organs. If violence was on a scale, it'd be a 9/10. There isn't much sex in the game, just one kiss and some sexually suggestive posters (women in bikinis), and an OPTIONAL note about a certain character saying he ""nearly came"" when he did a taxidermy on a tiger, creepy!
There's lots of swearing in this game, there are multiple uses of most swear words you can think of. I chose ""Positive Role Models"" because Leon and Claire are, at least in my opinion, good role models. Both do their best to protect the people they love and are very selfless. Overall, this is a really good game and if you are a fan of the OG Re2, or a survival horror fan in general, this is a must play!",0
"While this game contains literally no nudity (even partial), the game features a constant barrage of creepy imagery/sound, profanity and what is easily the most unpleasantly realistic gore I have ever seen. Now, having said that, it is a horror game exclusively for adults with some of the most heart-pounding sequences in gaming history. The zombies are scary enough, but throw in Lickers and the almost-Singing G-spawns, and you've got yourself an all-out nightmare. And that's before you throw Mr X into the mix, whom is absolutely terrifying because he plays with human survival instinct PERFECTLY; he's massive, almost unstoppable, and you can hear him stomp around looking for you, like a cross between a predator and The Terminator. Now, the original RE2 told a more wholesome version of the story here, and successfully fused horror with a somber, sad tone that this game doesn't even attempt, but on its own merits, this is genuinely as good as it gets. Just note that the violence is literally as high as it can go as it's brutal and disturbingly lifelike - I just don't mark it as, for adults, this only makes the overall package more compelling.",0
"This is a very solid remake of a very scary game. With updated graphics, this game has extremely dark and disturbing imagery. NOT FOR KIDS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.",0
"Parents need to know that this game is great, but only for adults and mature teens. Players will fight soldiers, carry out assassinations, and raid towns. Durring combat, every hit sprays blood on the environment. Also, there are special moves that you can do which are slightly more dramatic. They often have you chopping heads off, axes in heads, dismembering limbs, and more. Parents should note that you can turn off blood and gore in the settings menu. There is also a cutscene showing female breasts and occasional mild sexual content is spread through the story, but this can also be skipped by turning mature content off in the settings. And finally, there is some cursing throughout the game. The cursing includes F--k, S--t, and B-tch, but like the rest of the mature content in this game, this can be turned off. This game is fantastic. The graphics are great, the story is great, combat is smooth, and the game is just all around a blast to play. I reccomend this game to adults and mature teens if you turn off the mature content. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped.",0
"After few hours of research I said ok because it did not seem so bad for 18+. I do not normally allow these games, She asked me to look at here but there were not many reviews so I did not use but I think it is ok and so I'm putting my opinion. If your child is mature enough as a 15 year old then I think this is fine - especially if you think they are okay with something like call of duty. There is some violence and gore but it is not very much. Overall I would recommend because it is based on history and suitable if they are watching 15/16+ movies",0
"The blatant sexual content and unnecessary brutally sadly makes this game a no go for my 17 year old, and definitely my 12 year old. Based on previous reviews I thought the ratings were just for increasing popularity, not so.",0
This game is extremely violent and contains sexual images not appropriate for children or young teens. It is a wonderful game but it is for adults and is rated M for a reason.,0
While it is true that there is slight nudity decapitation and spurts of blood you can easily disable these features in settings at any time though i recommend that you do this straight away if you feel that you’re child cannot handle it.,0
"It has intense gory violence along with partial nudity, strong language and drugs and Alcohol not for young kids",0
"I believe that this game is fine for children, as long as they know enough about certain topics, and know that it’s not okay to do any of the stuff the antagonists do, if you child is on the younger side, you could set some boundaries, like only taking the friend option in female confidants, and sometimes playing in front of you.",1
"This game is okay for 10+ because the only real reason it should be higher is the bad language, but you can turn that off in the settings. The only other thing is the violence which certainly isn't as bad as other games where blood and organs explode from a person when they die. The only real point where the violence can be a bit extreme is where players have an option to stab an enemy multiple times in the back - even after they have clearly died - or snapping their neck. I have watched my 11 year old son play this and it's honestly not as bad as alot of the reviews say, most games are okay for kids once they have reached 11 or 12.",0
"In this game you are a Soldier and you are going to stop terrorists. It’s violent, but most of the game you are not shooting people, you are shooting robots.",0
"Like Dishonored, this game is dark, and will get very, very dark if the player lets it. This is precisely the reason I like it so much! As someone who deals with great emotional ebbs and flows, this game is an exercise in free-will that has proven to be as therapeutic as the first game. I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick reminder of what life becomes when you allow the negativity around you to affect your decisions.",0
"When my asked for this game I said I wold look at it. It is an amazing game, with little gory images.",1
"First parents need to understand that this game is rated ""M"" by the ESRB. The ESRB's content descriptors for the title include: Violence, Blood and Gore, Suggestive Themes, Drug Reference, Language, Use of Alcohol and Tobacco.
So, with that in mind this is an action game, based on the Batman universe, in which players assume the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman as he battles villains in Gotham City. Players can engage in various action sequences that require timed button presses to successfully punch, kick, and incapacitate enemy thugs and villains; blood is frequently shown as characters are injured. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: characters inside a chamber killed by machinery; fingers cut off by saw blades.One innocent person has their throat ripped out with a hook. In one interrogation sequence, players(as Batman) can repeatedly pummel an unarmed prisoner for information. The words ""Pr*ck, Sh*t, B*tch, *ss and F*ck ""appear in the dialogue.",0
"TL;DR: This game is NOT suitable for younger teenagers or children. It is unlikely to be suitable for those experiencing an episode of severe mental illness, especially if this includes derealisation or depersonalisation. While it deals with politics in a way which can be enlightening, it is a blunt instrument and is not appropriate for young people who have shown an interest in political extremism, especially the alt-right.
The Game:
In Disco Elysium, you play a man who wakes up without his memory following a breakdown and a likely alcohol and drug overdose, only to be informed by strangers that he is a detective investigating a lynching in an extremely deprived post-war neighbourhood. Uniquely, much of the dialogue is internal, with the character choosing to examine his thoughts in a way that ultimately informs who he is.
I'll attempt to not spoil *too much* of the game here, but I'm going to break this down into sections because there are so many challenging aspects to it.
Messaging:
Disco Elysium deals mainly with political themes and the impact of war and poverty on ordinary people. Many situations are morally gray, and you are forced to ignore many smaller issues to deal with the murder you are investigating. Players are guided by Kim and the plot itself to reject racism and political extremes, with a slight left-wing skew that nonetheless condemns violence in the name of communism, as well as violence in the name of suppressing it. Players encounter fascism and eugenics early on in the game, and are urged to reject them through the use of logic and rhetoric.
The game gives the clear message that addiction and mental illness are made worse by a person's experience and situation, and explores this both through the main character, and through other characters, who have experienced abuse, warfare, are refugees being hunted down, or union members willing to ignore the corruption of the union boss.
Role Models:
In this game, you play the bad role model suffering from the consequences of just how bad of a role model he has been. There are however other characters who could be seen as role models in the game, in particular, your partner, Kim, who is the moral compass and foil for your character. Kim is a ""moralist"", the political centre of the game, and moderate in most ways. He encourages the player to do the ""right"" thing, avoid drugs and alcohol, racism, corruption, being inappropriate, and descending into a spiral of mental illness. Kim is gay and mixed raced as a foil to the many bigoted characters, and native to the city the game is set in. He is not depicted as totally flawless or straightlaced, however, and will make deals when forced for the greater good, and also smokes ""one cigarette per day"" - it is implied that he does this to look cool, though he discourages you from doing the same.
Ease of Play
The game is point-and-click with narration and text for all dialogue. All ""difficult"" aspects take the form of skill checks, based on your level in a given skill added to a random dice roller. This can be frustrating but is not generally challenging.
Conceptually the game may be very challenging for some players, requiring at least some knowledge of the political systems it is meant to explore. It would be possible for someone without much knowledge to mistake the game's intent as being fascist or racist, when it intends to attack these ideologies.
Mental Health
Mental illness is a recurrent theme, often as the result of a person's circumstances and experiences. (SPOILERS:) You find out that your character had a suicidal breakdown and threatened to kill himself with his gun before driving his car off a bridge. You can choose to pursue more or less mentally healthy thought processes, which impact your ""moral"" in the game. If your moral is reduced to 0, you lose your grip on reality and have a breakdown, ending the game.
With no memories of others, you are socially isolated until you build a relationship with Kim, your partner, and are constantly threatened with thoughts that no one loves or cares about you. Unless you are abusive to him, Kim tries to spare you from these thoughts and discourages destructive behaviour. Your belief that no one cares about you is hinted to be false by the game, as some badly disguised colleagues show up to check on you, who you cannot recal. They are depicted as frustrated and suffering from the fallout of your addiction and eratic behaviour.
One mechanic in the game is ""thoughts"", which you must think about for a given period of time before you internalise them and gain benefits and/or penalties for doing so. These range from the idea that you are clearly a superstar (you aren't), to spending 8 hours thinking about your own sexuality in order to stop obsessing over it, to thinking you must be the last communist in the world. Some of these thoughts have negative impacts on your abilities and present you with dialogue options which could be seen as depressing, judgemental, bigoted, or hopeless.
If someone who was experiencing severe suicidal ideation or depersonalisation were to play this game, it is possible that they could enter an-in character downwards spiral which would confirm their unhealthy mindset.
Violence
There are limited options to commit violence in the game, as you have lost your gun and your partner rarely offers you his. Even if you regain your gun, you can only find 2 bullets in the game.
However, violence and its effects on people and society are very strong themes in the game.
The setting of the game is a neighbourhood that was bombed and then invaded by foreign powers seeking to crush a communist rebellion. Bullet holes line the walls of many buildings, and you have an in-depth scene investigating the decades old execution of unknown victims by an unknown firing squad. Various other war crimes are recounted.
A man is hanging by the neck from a tree outside the hostel you wake up in. A boy throws rocks at the corpse.
You can shoot a girl who is verbally abusing you, killing her. If you do this, your partner immediately arrests you for murder, ending the game.
You can punch a boy verbally abusing you in the face.
You can attempt to fight a racist man who will not allow you to pass him.
There is a shoot-out in the game, which is depicted as a traumatic event.
A woman uses a new-age weapon against you, possibly killing you.
You can perform two ""field autopsies"" in the game, one of which is watched by local children and includes looking at the genitals and last meal of a week-old corpse (not depicted but briefly described).
Sex
SPOILER: In the game, a man is shot while having sex, which is verbally recounted in moderate detail.
You can attempt to seduce people in the game but it does not lead to sex or a relationship.
You obsess about your own sexuality until you unlock a ""thought"" called Homo-sexual Underground. This reveals your partner's sexuality and stops the various questioning scenarios whenever you meet an attractive woman or man.
Sexual Violence:
SPOILERS: A rape is alleged in the game, and strongly condemned by characters in the game. However, the player character has the opportunity to be more or less supportive of the victim - if you appear confrontational or unsupportive, other characters will get angry.
A recording of a man appearing to threaten rape in a way that is distinctly violent and alludes to war crimes is played, but it is revealed that this was ""just banter"". Again, other characters are disgusted by this and condemn it, but the player is left to make up their own opinion.
Through your investigation, you may conclude that a murder in the game was sexually motivated.
Themes of abuse
Themes of abuse are frequent throughout the game. In addition to the rape, a boy describes his father as frighteningly violent (if the player, optionally, punches him in the face), and when you investigate you conclude he is the victim of domestic violence. The boy and a girl shout that you are there to physically and sexually abuse them or kill them. For their age (or indeed any age), they have experienced far too much and choose to watch you perform a field autopsy on the lynched man.
A location in the game is described as a place where drunk fathers beat their sons.
It is alleged (by the player character and his partner) that a rich bureaucrat may be sexually exploiting a young man whose apartment he pays for.
A young girl is prevented from attending most of her education by her mother so that she can work outside in the snow all day for no pay. The player can confront the mother on the ethics of this.
Racism, misogyny, homophobia etc.
There are frequent and severe instances of all forms of discrimination in the game. Your character is usually free to condemn, ignore, or support these, or sometimes to commit them. Occassionally, if you fail a mental check, you may be left with only one, compulsory dialogue option that is blatantly discriminatory (for example, you can fail a check when arguing with your partner and call him a racial slur, causing conflict in your relationship).
In the game, racial slurs are replaced with fictional slurs, though their impact is comparable to real-life. Multiple characters in the game express racist, fascist and eugenecist views, which your partner condemns (and is sometimes the victim of), but which your character can respond to as they like.
Race is suggested as a motivation for the lynching in the game, and a man talks about the measurements of your skull and your ""haplotype"", or genetic ancestry. You can choose to ""subscribe to his racial views"" to get him to do what you want, or challenge him.
Homophobic slurs are censored in the game, but frequently used; children shout that you and your partner are F-slurs. There are several gay characters in the game, which you can respond to as you wish, but (SPOILERS) your partner may reveal he is gay, and condemns or ignores homophobic abuse and attitudes.
It is possible in the game to acquire a jacket with the word ""P*SSF****T"" written on it by ""confiscating"" it from some teenagers (with the word F**** censored, visually and audibly), though the motivation behind it seems more abstract than homophobic. A lesbian character is liked and supported by a group of other characters.
Misogyny
The world the game is set in parallels our own, with a history of repression against women which is slowly diminishing. Your character has vague memories of a woman from his past which develop into an unhealthy obsession if you continue thinking of her. Your character can embrace or turn away from ""toxic masculinity"", by challenging thoughts about women being wh***s or allowing them to continue.
Some other characters have clearly misogynistic views, although this is less common than racist and homophobic ones.
Swearing
Frequent and severe. No real-world racial slurs are used in the game. Children in the game swear at you and your partner, including fictional racial slur and homophobic slurs. These children are depicted as victims of abuse and neglect to be pitied. Children whose parents are less/not abusive do not tend to swear at you.
Consumerism
Almost all goods in the game are second hand or bought from the back of a lorry. The area it is set in is very deprived. The only new goods to be bought are books and boardgames, medications, drugs, and dice from an artisan dicemaker. Real-world brands are not depicted and there are no microtransactions.
Drugs, alcohol, smoking
Frequent and severe. Your character is an alcoholic and possibly a drug addict, and it is clear as you play (and commented by your partner and others around you) that it has ruined both your life and your health.
You do not need to drink, smoke or do drugs while playing, but they are frequently available. Doing drugs, alcohol, or smoking each have benefits in the form of stat boosts, but damage your health. Abusing drugs and alcohol too frequently can lead you to being too unstable to complete the game, or even to your character's death.
Other characters are depicted on drugs, including the aforementioned abused children. An optional quest is to steal drugs from an abused boy's father, who is passed out drunk.
Safety and Privacy
You don't share any information with the game. It is a single-player game.",0
Amazing game with beautiful graphics amazing gameplay and music. The story isn’t as good as the first but still very interesting and brilliant acting. The game contains high levels of violence but it’s not exaggerated like Mortal Kombat. The swearing is quite bad but nothing more you than what you would hear in middle school/secondary school. I think mature thirteen year olds and 14 year olds can play it and definitely 15 year olds.,0
"This is a great game, while it has gore, violence, and swearing, if your child is mature this game should be fine. Don’t listen to some of these reviews, the game is amazing and will be looked back on as an underrated masterpiece",0
"The last of us part 2 is an amazing game, some can argue the main plot is nowhere as good as the first but it still is a beautiful game. It takes place in a world riddled with infected or commonly known as “zombies” and you play as a young female on a quest for revenge. The violence in the game is stunning, and one of the only video games which has made me think once or twice about what I just did, every human you kill feels real and even has a name which can be heard by others screaming their name, even the dogs you kill don’t solely feel mindless, but actually feel like someone’s pet. You use various weapons ranging from a pickax to a machete or a small pistol to a shotgun that can blow off limbs with the click of a button. The game also has a graphic sex scene and also nudity scene around the dark world. There is some drug use but only scene shows it explicitly. Language can be heard at school and is nothing too bad",0
"This game is one of the best games I've ever played. There is some violence but nowhere near as bad as GTA or Call of Duty. And yes there is a couple sex scenes but nothing a 13 year old couldn't handle. The story , I will admit that it is not great but to be fair, most of the bad reviews are because people do not like how it mocks the first game's story but in my opinion its pretty good. There is some blood but as I said before nothing a 13 year old couldn't handle and it is nowhere near as bad as GTA or Call of Duty. The swearing is not so bad, nothing so bad as f*ck and most kids at this age who would play this game either hear the swearing at school or may even say it themselves. All in all, I personally love this game even though the story is a bit of a let down, its a great game.",0
"A stunning, emotional, violent and very clever story. Can't shake it off after completing it. Story telling at this standard eclipses pretty much anything I've witnessed in any form. Subverts expectations on a level I'm never witnessed before, but makes you think and raises a mirror to the world we live in through an imagined one. However, characters are tortured and the violence is relentless. Also I found myself really on edge constantly due to pressures of the game, I honestly feel it can affect your anxiety barometer if played for long stretches. This is an adult game with adult themes, and I wouldn't recommend for under-aged kids.",0
"This game is honestly an example of an nc-17 rated game which means no children the reason for that is there is lots of characters who drink excessively there are couple characters who smoke too, there are also multiple scenes with graphic nudity and a sex scene by 2 characters included but can be skipped, swearing is just all over the game far worse than an average r rated movie and any call of duty games I would say at least a total of 300 uses of f**k and much more swearing mainly in cut scenes but however compared to the first game this game is around 23 hours long but still a lot of exceptionally foul language, and violence well let me just be honest do to how violent this game is just too much honestly just too much probably one of the most violent games ever made far more violent than the first overall this game isn’t for kids for all these reasons this is a very hard 18+ rated game.",0
"First off if your child is sensitive to gore like large amounts don’t let them play this game has dismemberment face blowing off limbs etc
But this game story wise is amazing telling two main characters stories and having one on the side",0
"Naughty Dog's The Last of Us: Part II is a feat of storytelling and artistic game design. An engaging story paired with thrilling gameplay and ""gore""geous graphics makes for a breathtaking playthrough. However, this story is not for children or young teens. On the surface, the level of graphic violence is not suitable for young eyes. During combat scenes, main characters stomp enemies' heads in, smash heads into walls, explode bodies (bloody limbs are shown flying), set people and ""zombies"" on fire, shoot and stab enemies (a testament to superb programming, when slashing an enemy with a knife, bloody gashes appear on the body). Enemies can be heard screaming, begging for mercy, yelling for help, etc. Players are also forced to kill dogs that attack them.
The plot itself is violence-centric. Our hero sets out on a revenge-fueled quest to hunt down and kill an entire group of people. Both main characters grapple with the murder of a loved one.
However, TLOU II uses this violence to both horrify and engage players. It questions where the line between humanity and monstrosity lies by using proximity to a literal perversion of humanity (the infected ""zombies""). It provokes an investigation into the validity of revenge plots and the dangers of cycles of violence. Dealing with heavy commentary on empathy, human evil, sickness, fear, and rage, the story also showcases diversity (including prominent LGBT characters and characters of color). This game is arguably one of the best ever written. Set in a lonely, dangerous world after the end of ours, The Last of Us: Part II dares to ask: After being corrupted by rage and consumed by violence, are we still ""us""? How evil do we have to be to lose our humanity? In a world overrun with infected monsters, how different are we from them, and how many of us are still the last of us?",0
"Fantasy violence, language, very nondescript sex scenes. That's essentially all you need to know.",0
"I'm not a big fan of video games, but I have to be honest here and say that this game is great. I loved it, played it more than once and loved it until the very end - which is disappointing.
About the age rating, it is obvious by the marking Bioware company gave it - not for kids. It includes lots of violence, strong language, sex and so on. No arguing of any kind about it.",0
In my personal opinion this is more of a action based story then the other two where mainly because of the fact that it can be played as a shooter without any dialog choices at all depending on how you set it up in the beginning,1
"This game is amazing, the main character, Shepard, has to face the invasion of the Reapers, ancient machines whose sole purpose is to wipe out life in the galaxy. Along the way Shepard builds companion ships with his or her crewmates, and can potentially romance one. The game has a very strong message of hope. This game is not really for kids, I'd recommend maybe 15 or 16 and over. It is the most violent of the Mass Effect series, the gore isn't too gratuitous, the worst thing you'll see is a head exploding in a very small mess, which isn't as bad as it sounds.",0
"Violence is really only the main issue in ME3. When using a sniper rifle, players can shoot off enemy heads and leave blood spewing out. Then there are other weapons the player can use to literally blow up bodies with. IT IS MESSY",0
The story is great and it is appropriate for 10 year olds.,1
You have fun blasting the evil people. Good story but does have blood if anyone has played call of duty the they’ll be fine with this game,0
Ok there is quite a bit of violence in this game however it is fine for children 10 and up as long as they understand war and violence and blood.,0
"Has large creative worlds that allow enough freedom without bloating into the recently increasingly saturated open world genre. Looks pretty feels pretty. Less blood than prev games yet more internal injury damage. All weapons Xray so thats cool. Yet there is still no outside damage shown om bodies after a devastating xray kill and that still sucks even more in 8th Gen. Blood splats on ground when shot up close, explosions bloody victims.",0
"I love this game as much as anyone, but it game was made for people who are high school age and older, and for good reason. It has a positive message overall, but so many tragedies occur along the way that kids and preteens likely won't understand it. Additionally, the game is much too long to maintain the attention of a child, so the game will likely be forgotten before the ultimate message is conveyed.",0
"This game is really good, and don't make the ""violence"" make you think otherwise, as the game doesn't really highlight the violence too much. The game also opens the player's eyes of the concept of ""Memento mori"" (Remember that you are mortal. Remember that you will die) and the value of friendship, as this game has several in-game casualties and they are really heartbreaking. The Social Links (people you hang out) in this game are really worthwhile. Try it out. There's very little swearing and sometimes unintentional dirty jokes.",0
"Persona 3 is a decent game but the game is full of dark themes that just arent suitable for children. For example, to summon your ""persona"" in the game your character has to shoot themselves in the head with a gun of sorts called an ""evoker"" which children just wont understand. There is also a lot of death in Persona 3 and it is really morbid, every character suffers and it is not light hearted by any means. The theme of the game is making the most of life like it's your last day which once again is too mature for a child to really read in to. The language is not much of an issue in the game and it is not particularly bloody or gory either. In conclusion, children should wait till they are of a decent age before playing this game.",0
Shin Megami Tensei is by far the greatest game i have ever played. It cannot be described but experienced. The game which has been claimed to be the best RPG ever is the best. The game was so popular they remade it on the psp just so you could play it again in a different way. The game is a blend of 'The Sims and Final Fantasy'. All of the Shin Megami games are turn based RPG's were you control demons. This particular one lands you as a highschool student in japan. You live in a mysterious dorm with many eccentric characters. One night you are awaken at night too find a demon has attacked. You are given an 'evokor' a gun that summons your 'Persona' or inner guardian and protector. Soon you have extrodianry powers of summoning demons. Now to get to the important part of what offensive content is in this game. First off you are summoning demons which might sound bad but you always use your demons for the good of the cause. Many of the demons have phallic shaped heads noses etc. but graphic. A handful of feminine demons have expossed breast but no nipples are visible. The violence is very tame with blood somties on walls and in a few cutscences. The main reason this game got rated m is because when you summon your persona you stick your evokoe pistol to your head and fire it simulating suicide but no blood comes out. If you tween is mature with the adult themes and scariness of the game i would highly recommend it. The game has many positive themes and is good vs evil.,0
this would be a adult only game if the sex wasn't totally optional. The violence can be quite strong but is never something too brutal and can be coped by a 13 year old. I have seen my child play this game of pan and first I wanted him to remove it but know I realise it is fine for him and any other 13 year old.,0
"I was looking at this game and the first thing I saw was nudity. Which lead to a, no. After I played it myself, I found that you did not have to go into the brothel where the main character could have sexual intercourse for points. The brothel Is out of the way and I did not notice it at first. In the minigame you do not see the character having sexual intercourse but the bed is shaking and moaning can be heard. There are just a few topless demons in this game which is when the nudity came into play, but you will not even notice since you are to busy fighting. I think any teenager could play this game since they have most likely already been exposed to violence, and health class.",0
"This game is actually awful for kids, but my boyfriend had me try it and it was pretty fun. You should not let you're child near this game until they are at least 15.",0
"This is a great Trilogy with an amazing storyline it does contain adult scenes in all three of the series it is a story driven game with romance options depending on you play style and it does include a ""social meet"" with your romance of choice near the end of each installment there are also certain characters that express adult mannerisms IE bad language and sexual references but that's just part of it it does provide great role models depending on if you play good over bad morally",0
"Excesive amount of violence (despite the fact that game rewards you for not killing anyone): the scenes of neck-snapping, penetrating enemies with a blade etc. are not the only reason of PEGI 18 rating. Children under the age of 17 will not understand this game, they dont notice the fight between the police who straight up abuse a group of people and the people getting abused. The game explains the way terrorism works on practice, which is also not for kids. Also a lot of scenes of people lying dead, rotting after they died due to drugs, alcohol, poison etc. The scene of Rucker's death would alone make this game not for kids.",0
This game is a bit bloody. Blood spurts from enemies when they are shot or stabbed. Language can be strong (f--k) but it's infrequent. Sex is limited to references to it and one stripper in a bar club (no nudity).,0
"This game is the sequel to the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC game Deus Ex Human Revolution. This game has very deep and interesting questions about the human condition. Meaning it's far too complex for many children. You play the game as a EX-Swat member Adam Jensen, he is a pretty decent role model to kids and adults as he always has good morals and agendas. This game is great for older kids as whilst the box says 18 it is definitely more like a 15 with the language, sex and violence settings turned down to minimum. This game is definitely a suitable game for 15+ children as it has such a vast array of settings making the game completely fine. One thing that can't be turned off however is the smoking and drinking, despite this they are very much in the background and shouldn't influence your child too much.
Overall though its an extremely immersive cyberpunk adventure with a deep plot and a wide variety of useful and practical content settings",0
Good game with not too much blood or violence it is great for teens and people who are enthusiastic about playing great games. Kids who are mature,0
Lots of exploding heads/bloody wounds that expose viscera and limbs fly everywhere. Lighthearted fun for teens.,0
I think It has good messages about fighting for your rights But iffy stuff is best left for teens,1
I think its good for age 12 because drugs cursing and some violence,0
"Contains: Minimal Sex, Minor Blood Towards Realistic Characters, Major illegal Drugs! Cop Abuse, scary scenes and emotional fear! Very bad language blasphemy like the f- word.",0
It is not okay for even an adult to be playing this unless they are okay with pornography. It is NOT appropriate in my opinion.,0
"Parents need to know that there are three different modes in this game: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. There isn't very much blood or gore except in the Zombies mode. Most people will play Call of Duty for the Multiplayer, which is a mode where you play against other players. This game has lots of explosive action and shooting. It is very intense, but not very bloody. The zombies mode is pretty scary and gory, but lots of fun. Working together with teammates is really necessary in order to win. Shooting zombies will always spray blood and when you shoot a zombie's head or limb it will get blasted off. The Campaign has occasional uses of F--k and Sh-t but it is not very often. There are some disturbing parts in the campaign, but not as much as the previous game. Sometimes you will stab people or choke them out, so this mode is more mature then the Multiplayer mode. Most teens can handle it. I would recommend the Multiplayer mode for age 13, Campaign for age 15, and zombies for age 16. Parents should also know that content such as the blood and cursing can be turned off in the settings. However there will still be lots of shooting and explosions. Thanks for reading.",0
"There are few games out there that have as good of a storyline as this game.
The entire game they have you thinking one thing and at the end, there is a major plot twist. The campaign is not as large as the other Cods but it has more impact. It tells a story based on the Cold War and the secret operative known as Perseus. You are trying to kill or detain perseus before he can detonate nuclear bombs planted all over Europe and blame it on the U.S.
There is a ton of language including F--k, Sh-t, and P--sy. There is an option to turn off blood and gore, but im not sure if there is one to turn off language, you might want to check that out. If your kid has played any of the Cod series then this shoul be okay for him/her.",0
The violence is very gory but only in the Zombies but in the multiplayer there basically no cussing campaign has the most cussing it has glory kills which are quite violent. For example you break there hip and then stab them in the neck and then shoot them in the head and pull out the knife. There is drugs in the campaign the reason is SPOILER ALERT you need to find out who you are and the injection makes you hallucinate and you are actually a Russian Terrorist and you can chose to betray everyone.,0
"I saw my children playing this game and it is really not as bad as I heard from some other parents on facebook. Not much gore, and lots of co-operatian.",1
"When I first bought this game, I thought it was a normal fps. Let me tell you I was wrong. So I set it up in the console. In the first 2 hours of gameplay I realized this game was AWESOME.
Violence
Tons. Lots of gory headshots, stabbings, and beatings. Character's faces are stomped in. All in all I believe this game teaches kids about the real world. Growing up, I witnessed and committed these things quite frequently. It was awesome too, but after several incarcerations I decided to just play bloody games instead. Let your kids play this, and I, Bert Grierington, promise they will end up with a better salary than I (0$ an hour)",1
"The general chat in this game is full of the most filthy, disgusting, sexist, racist, demeaning to women language I've seen in any game. I myself am a gamer and have been since the late nineties. Please keep your children out of this game. In addition to the filth in general chat it contains non-consensual player to player combat. The game is not advertised as such but anyone, after level fifty, can be drawn into combat, like it or not. This is not a child's game at all.",0
"I would personally say that the game is best played by ages 15 and up. To be fair a lot of people like to complain about it and say it is a terrible game and the community is ruining it, but from what I have seen so far in my time of playing it the community seems just fine and quite honestly no one should judge a MMORPG off of the community since if that was the case The Elder Scrolls Online would be done for by now since out of all the MMORPGs I have played that one is on of the worst community wise. So my advice is give it a try, don't go in to any MMORPG for the community, and one should probably be 15+ to play since it does have a bit of provocative outfits for the females and of course all in all it is an online game where you do end up one time or another chatting with real people who also play it.",0
"Black Desert Online is NOT appropriate for kids under the age of 18+ and personally I would NOT allow my kids to join this Community.
Hands down, Black Desert Online has the most toxic game community I have ever experienced so far.
Often seen comments on the game server chat are Racist, Profane, Sexually Explicit and very detailed, Rape culture, Bullying that goes as far as telling a kid to commit suicide.
Black Desert Online has NO chat moderators and kids are let to ""soak"" in all the hate that pretty much comes from older players and adults.",0
"Gamer of 40 years here, and father to sub 10 y/o sons.
BDO is not Animal Crossing.
It's certainly not a light game for younger audiences.
However, with the right oversight and guidance it's an incredibly complex and rewarding time sink that boasts cutting edge visuals and an unprecedented depth to it's game systems.
Another reviewer complained about 'forced PvP'. In 4 years of playing this game I have never once been engaged in player to player combat.
It's there if you want it, but easily avoided and no barrier to enjoying the game.
The same reviewer also stated that players are not made aware of forced PvP combat - this is entirely incorrect. Player to player combat is only available after level 50, and players must complete a specific action to unlock it.
Full warnings are given, and all non combat activities can be accessed without passing level 50.
The general in game chat can indeed be toxic, as is the case with many mmo games, but the chat window is easily deactivated (I never engage with it at all).
There are numerous Discord channels for different character builds that are all super helpful, and sites like GrumpyGreenCricket offer excellent guides for new players.
Obviously, the usual rules apply as with any online game and parents should
BDO's depth and strength lies in its 'Lifeskill' activities - farming, fishing, mining etc, and in this sense it does resonate with games like Animal Crossing.
However, BDO'S systems are incredibly complex and multilayered, and require time to master (not to mention a spreadsheet!).
There's an active economy which gives these activities purpose and relevance.
Non player combat (fighting monsters etc) is as complex as any dedicated fighting game, and takes time to master. Combat includes some blood, but this can be turned off in the settings.
Yes, there's a cash shop, so parents need to establish their boundaries, and some of the female character armour is 'glamorous'. However, there's no nudity or bad language in game.
BDO is a 'grown up' game in the sense that it requires and develops patience, maths, and organisation at a high level.
However, I'd rather my kids explore this world than the endless loop of Fortnite or the bully simulator of Among Us.
BDO used an anti cheat system to regulate fair play, so parents should familiarise themselves with what that means in terms of privacy (answer- nothing much on a day to day level). Following a change in publisher last year, this system has moved from the slightly notorious XIGNcode to EasyAntiCheat, which is also used by Fortnite, so is much less of an issue.",0
"Black Desert Online is a good game with good morals. Some female outfits can be revealing though never show any nudity. If your child stays away from those females and those clothes and stays around the clothes that cover, than it's a great game. Blood and gore is very moderate and so is everything else. I think ages 12+ can handle such matters and treat them appropriately. If you trust that your child can than it's a great game. Even some mature 10-11 year old's can play it too.",0
"First off, the other reviewers overly dramatize their reviews. The swearing is there, but it's no more than a PG-13 movie. Even so, you tend not to notice it as you're too busy taking care of your horse, eating, or fending off foes. Next topic is sexual themes. Throughout my whole game play, I only encountered one sexual theme/reference. And, that was a girl requesting to wash me in the bathtub. You are easily able to decline this, and even if you do accept nothing is shown. She is still a fully dressed woman. Overall, this game is incredible and hands down game of the year. I rarely let my 14-year old even watch PG-13 movies, but this game he just has to experience. You can either be a good outlaw, or a bad outlaw, and that choice is up to you. At the end, the story leads you in a way that makes you feel bad if you're a bad outlaw and teaches you to be a good respectable citizen. Again, it's just a fantastic story. If you, or your kid, has the money to purchase this game then I highly recommend it. Thanks for your time, - Trusted Parent Reviews.",0
"Red Dead Redemption 2 Is a fabulous game. I, myself have played it for about 45 hours. Recently, my child asked if he could play the game. I said sure. He's only 12 and we played together for 2 hours. He enjoyed it extremely much and asked if I could buy it for him. I said yes because, I've played it for over 45 hours and I am excited to let you know that this game is perfect. The game is rated M, and it is rated this for language, violence, and nudity. I want to let you know that the violence in this game is low to none. When you shoot someone, small puffs of blood come out of the enemy. But, it is not overly graphic. There is no gore, or at least I haven't seen any so far, and language is in there. The language is definitely the biggest factor for rating this game M but, even that is hard to find. The main character curses using the words S**t and B***h once or twice every 15-25 minutes. This is extremely low for a M rated game. Also, the F word is used three times in the entire game so far. These times were only in the story mode/campaign and they were from the Irish. The Irish are not a main part of the story and can be bypassed if wanted. That's it for language. For nudity, there is only one thing: horse genitalia. Horses have these, but they are only found it you are deliberately looking for them, you would have to kill your own horse so that it falls over and then you would have to get a weapon with a scope to see them. They are invisible to the naked eye. That's pretty much it aside from one scene in the entire story where you can go and purchase a deluxe bath for a large portion of money. The deluxe bath has no more gains to it from the regular bath except for a lady, fully clothed, comes in and bathes you. No nudity is shown, not even for a second and only one time does she put her hand deep into the water and bring it up to wash your arm. It looks as if had she might be washing your character's unmentionables but, it was confirmed by the director of the game that she is just getting her hand wet to wash off the mud off your arm. Finally, that's it. I will update this review if I find anything else that is not family-friendly but, right now I can't find anything that isn't. Thanks for spending the time to read this and I would definitely recommend buying this for your child if they are into the old West. Thanks again and have a good day!",0
"I agree with Common Sense Media’s rating suggesting that adults only play this game. So far, I have played for a few hours and made it out of the snow to the campsite. I find it surprising that the “parents” on CSM are suggesting younger ages than the kids are. What I have seen and heard so far is not excessive as some mature rated titles are (such as the new Doom games), but it is still appropriate for the mature rating it has received.
Violence and gore: So far, I have seen several shootouts, a fist fight, a dead horse on the ground with its guts sprawled into the snow and urine underneath it, and a decapitated body strung up underneath some train tracks with blood dripping from the body, and guts on the ground. To the side of the lower half of the body is also a head of the character that is pinned against the wooden post with some form of stake and a paper inserted into its mouth. A lot of the violence is what can be seen in some Teen rated games, such as the Uncharted series, but there are occasional scenes that are more graphic, such as the slow motion deaths that show realistic detail of where the person was shot with blood splattering through the air. You can also drive a knife into your enemies to kill them. Depending on your actions, they could be cold-hearted killings or self preservation. There is one moment in the game where you can kick a man who is hogtied on the ground. There is another where you have a choice of how to deal with a man who you got into a fistfight with. I don’t remember the choices, but there is a more harsh and a more kind option to choose from.
Language: The language in the game is appropriate for the situation. Again, it is not gratuitous. There are periods of time where there is no language at all, and there are other periods where I have heard language that would be heard in a Teen game as well. There is a character in a saloon who talks about a pig’s anatomy and I’ve heard one F-word in the few hours of gameplay that I’ve been through.
Sex/Nudity: So far, there has not been any nudity or sexual content, besides a female character walking around in the background of camp with a low-cut top.
Drugs: There are options to use cigarettes in the game. Some characters can be seen smoking as well. I don’t recall any drinking yet.
The controls in the game are consistent with the previous Red Dead Redepmtion, but they can be confusing depending on the situation. For example, the R2 button (on the PS4) is used to shoot, but there was a time that I was prompted to use the R2 button to point my gun at some people to convince them to get into a train. It felt like this would have shot them, which I wasn’t wanting to do. Another thing with the controls is holding down buttons while navigating menu systems, such as the equipment wheel, and other buttons that have to be held—at least briefly—before getting the response from the system. I have been confused at times when it is safe to release the held button/buttons, which is somewhat complicated for playing.
Overall, the game is amazing and I’m excited to experience more of it! The story, direction, acting, musical score, graphical detail, and the world that the experience is set in is fantastic! I appreciate that the game is not afraid to slow down to show the player that there is a living world to experience, not just run through and shoot up. The contrast from the snowy environment with few wildlife encounters, and then going to warmer forrests with believable animals going about their own lives in herds and realistically responding to approaching humans is mind-boggling. I can’t imagine all the time even one person spent on the detail that was added to make this more than just a game, but an experience that is convincing.
I’ve gone on long enough about content that is separate from the age rating for the game, but I would highly recommend it for appropriate audiences.",0
"First of all, RDR2 is a great game, with an immensely interesting and immersive story, but, very graphic. Some reasons why I recommend RDR2 for kids 15 and up, would be because of lots of gore, language, and mature themes. For example, people can be shot, stabbed, lassoed, mutilated, dismembered, Etc. Characters will have frequent conversations with mature themes, such as sex and alchohol. Also, People at the saloons will drink, and it will often cause them to blackout, your character can drink, and others too. There is lots of swearing, with people constantly using the F-word, and B-word. Finally, consumerism is present in this title, you can buy gold bars with real money, and money in-game. These are a few reasons why I think RDR2 is for kids 15 and up.",0
If your kids can handle the language and the violence of blowing peoples heads off with shotguns it's for you.,0
"Violence, Language and a lot more are expected from Rockstar Games. With titles such as the Grand Theft Auto series, you expect this. While RDR2 is tame compared GTA, and very fun to play, I would not allow my kids to play based on the aforementioned reasons. Adult themed games are wonderful, but they need to stay in the hands of adults, and there is no exception for this title!!",0
"Honestly I think this game is wrong to be rated a 18(m)
As it is only slightly gory and has a few swear words but it also shows the importance of friendship and loyalism and while you can tie people up and drag them behind your horse for example that isn't a necessary part of the game and if you trust your child to be matuer it is a great game it also accurately and beautifully covers the issue of the natives fighting a war with the us army, as your character you are helping the natives reclaim stolen land and sacred objects.
I would also hate for a child to miss out on this game as the storyline is entertaining and fun yet emotionally deep to the point of tears and the graphics are the best I have seen
In conclusion it would be horrible for a mature teen to miss out on this amazing game because of the age rating on the box.",0
"Over the past day I have been playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I played the first one and loved it. I could of done without the sexual themes in it though and it would not of affected me at all. I am aware that there is over 60 hours of gameplay so I do not know everything about the game. When playing the game there is lots of foul language but no more than what you would hear at your average middle school. F- bomb, sh@t, B@tch. I am ok with the language and the violence for my kid as because I know he is mature enough to handle it. I just did not let him play it at first because of the nudity. Unlike the last Red Dead and GTA 5 the sexual content is dialed down quite a bit in this game. The character you play as can not have sex with other characters at all in the game. There is cleavage shown a bit and a males genitals are shown though in a non-sexual way. There are only two scenes with a little engagement with sexual activity. During the storyline you save a woman from being raped but during the other scene you walk in on a man and a woman having sex. I believe that if your child is mature enough for this game and is 12-13 years or older s/he should be aloud to play this game. It is much better than some of Rockstars other masterpieces.",0
"The game is great, but not for children under 14 because there is a lot of violence, blood and swearing, I recommend it for the game because it is very fun and interesting.",0
"So I’ve seen plenty of other reviews saying this game is appropriate for kids as young as 10, but they clearly haven’t seen the sexual, graphic and generally inappropriate scenes. Most of those things are stumbled upon by chance and you won’t see on every play through, though none are inherently ‘bad’, just not appropriate for younger players. Other than that the graphics are fantastic, the story moving and the characters beautifully thought out. Definitely recommend for mature gamers :)",0
"I first should warn parents to keep anyone under 18 away from this game due to the pervasiveness of certain elements like coarse bad language and some violent disturbing scenes which mostly occur in the cutscenes between gameplay.
Some missions in the game, even when the player is trying to do them for high honor will still involve killing people.
And sometimes killing a certain character such as in bounty hunting missions will still yield good honor although usually not as much as taking them alive.
Or killing a character who is considered too evil to be kept alive.
As a counselor I simply don't believe that even truly evil people should have to die for their bad deeds.
What sets this game apart from others such as GTA however is that there is a good and bad honor system which increases positively when the player makes the right choices and refrains from committing crimes.
Or will decrease when the player steals, kills people or commits other criminal activity.
the high honor seems to give greater rewards than negative honor and it affects the ending as well.
this is the only reason why I would even begin to consider allowing any young adult to play.
It gives the option to work honestly for something you want instead of always stealing and killing for it like GTA which only rewards these negative choices and actions.
Be aware however that many who play will still be tempted in the game to do the wrong things and cause trouble and you may have to enforce your point and check their honor status to make sure they are following the conditions to play the game.
You may even have to play it with them until they can be trusted alone.
Rules are
Bad honor- game off.
Good honor- game on.
this in turn will keep the player from mercilessly rampaging, killing and torturing many innocent NPC's in the game and stealing which makes it far less violent.
Otherwise it is quite possible to do some extremely heinous and cruel inhuman things.
I even think I heard you can skin people and lynch them.
I've already seen that it is possible in the game to set fires which is a major NO to me and why I strongly urge intense thinking before letting anyone play.
It however also does reward slight positive honor for surrendering and accepting the consequences if the player should make a bad choice.
I'm not happy that it, like a GTA game still releases you from jail whenever you commit any crime including murder.
I would tell everyone to still avoid games like the GTA series in that there is no good or bad honor system and therefore it makes it seem like crime is the only way to win and therefore encourages it.
And certain characters in the Rdr series actually have good morals and aren't just a bunch of sick jokes like GTA.
again no younger individuals than 17 years old should play and they must understand the differences between a video game and real life.
if they keep their habits clean and they are playing responsibly then they will find this game still has much to offer and is worth it.
I might add that it has slight educational factors due to how it takes place in late 1800s early 1900 and players will want to know about history and how things were back in those days.
the world is jaw-dropping huge and most all of it can be explored without violence.
But only a top of the line gaming pc of 2019 or 2020 will have even a moderate chance of running this game at it's best.
you really will want this game, but it will cost you on it's own and dearly for the nessesary system to run it.
and also whatever happens DO NOT let your kids play Rdr ONLINE mode.
GTA as well as Rdr online is where some of the most dark and evil behaviors and influences can be found and the in-game can become a bloodbath with players shouting words like ""I hate you and I'll kill you!.
Players can form gangs who follow their own path and encourage others to commit crime and this by it's very nature simulates gang activity in real life.
Added to the fact that online gaming is not safe in many other ways.
you simply will not go one second without some young nerdy punk cursing and swearing and joking around.",0
"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an accurate depiction of what life was like in Western America in 1899. As someone who’s played through about two hours, I can tell you that it’s violent, with some sexual themes and drugs. So far, Arthur Morgan has prevented at least one rape, and there have been multiple violent shoot outs. But, despite its mature themes, Red Dead Redemption 2 presents an amazingly complex plot. Arthur Morgan faces many moral dilemmas, such as having to decide whether or not to spares band of thieves and murders. From my point of view, most mature thirteen and fourteen year olds will be able to recognize and deal with most mature themes in the game, but parents should be a little bit cautious letting kids 15 or under play.",0
"This games takes my breath away everyime I play. Beautiful scenery with a great combat system is the perfect pair. The developers really outdid themselves and have nailed this game down to the smallest details. It's moderately violent, death is part of the game though, yet it is in no way excessive and the blood can be turned off. I don't usually write reviews but this game definitely deserves one. On point.",0
"The game overall is great with the storytelling and combat mechanics. But it can get pretty violent at times: there's constant blood, brutal swordplay, setting people on fire, and some graphic cutscenes of people getting beheaded and mutilated. Although the blood can be turned off, it doesn't apply to the cutscenes. Some scenes show the main character's buttocks, but its only shown for a second or two, nothing worse. The least that you can be worried about is perhaps the language. It's very mild for an M rated game and can only be heard a few times throughout the game (S-word is the strongest you'll hear). Overall, a 16+ for the violence throughout the game.",0
"AMAZING, I cannot stress this enough, this game is a masterpiece. Along with that it isn’t violent, it’s only bad thing is that swords can have blood on them, but you can turn off blood.",1
This is a master piece of a game! The narrative along with the graphics were spot on. You can tell the studio really cares for their work and looking forward to see what else they can do with it. I feel it could be more gory as in if you slice off their arm you should see that etc but otherwise love the game and the game play. Really a outstanding job and very well done sucker punch.,0
"Its awsome. Its bloody but it's ok, you fight with swords,spears, bows and arrows etc. I dont think it should be rated 16.",0
Honestly the game is just a beautiful masterpiece. It makes you think about what your doing and it gives you a choice (most of the time) to be honorable or not. Blood can be turned off of your unsure about it. But the game is just so aesthetically please omg you would want your kids to have it,1
The main character Jin is a great person and everything he does is because of his code. In the game there is a mode in settings to turn off blood which makes it a lot less violent.,1
"M: intense violence, bloody images and language",0
It's rated for m 17+ and don't let under 17 play,0
"nice game,me and my friend are playing it right now!!! bad ice cream 3 on hudgames is the best game",1

"Extreme emphasis on violence and anger.
Fantastic soundtrack, the story is a bit hidden, but if you pay attention you will piece it together
Also for any parents wondering who the people that are getting are, in the game, we lost the cold war, they built a nuke first.
So russian mafia sets up shop in usa, gets political imunity and so a movement is started by vigilantees wearing animal masks, mostly x military to exterminate this russian threat",0
"Hotline Miami is a very, very good game with a compelling storyline, great soundtrack, and high replay value. However, it is very violent. There is a lot of blood and rather... crude ways of killing people. But bear in mind that all of this violence is pixelated, not the overly gory, clear violence in today's games. Also, I wouldn't recommend it if your child has a short attention span, high temper, or little patience. The game is quite difficult, and levels can require many retries before success. All in all, Hotline Miami is a great game for gamers who want something out of the ordinary, but I would not recommend it to kids under 14. But it really matters how mature your child is, and what you think is best for them.",0
"Don't think that this game is just a mindless murder game. Hotline Miami is one of those games that (for me) is able to convey a lot of emotions, it will your in-game actions onto you asking you ""Why are you doing this? Do you like hurting people?"" Its an amazing mashup of ultra-violence, horror, mystery and a psycho-thriller, a must play for any gamer.",0
"This game is great for zombie lovers and I have not seen a good zombie game since dying light. Now this is the thing about this game, the game is called “Back 4 BLOOD” so the creators of the game exaggerate how much blood there is when you kill a zombie. The language is fine for anyone 10 or older because curse words are very unusual to find in this game. The zombies can be scary for kids under 11 but this game is not any different from dying light and dead by daylight. Although there is a lot of blood and gore it’s nothing an average 11 year old or higher hasn’t seen before.",0
"This is a well crafted game with an interesting (if incomplete) storyline. However, this game is not for kids at all. This game contains extremely explicit violence and graphic content. Blood splatters with every gun shot and there are often blood pools on the floor and walls. There is also some strong language and some strong suggestive content, but the graphic violence is the biggest problem.",0
"This game is fairly violent with blood splatter and sometimes heads exploding if you get a headshot. Certain characters will be covered in blood at some points. The player can sometimes choose to slit the throats of enemies or knock them unconscious. However, the game is not violent enough that it should bother anyone who’s familiar with violent games or movies. It also has occasional swearing. Definitely not for young children and I wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t like violence in video games.",0
"Ehh, no the game is not okay for kids - its a semi-realistic war game with in my opinion very good and realistic graphics, it contains very graphical violence, and * SPOILER * at one point you are forced to shoot a lot of your own men, there are also scenes that involve some sort of torture... And like i said, everything here is depicted in quite a realistic manner, not in comic book style like some god of war (ps4) or borderlands (x360) the series with its complex story is not meant for kids anyways, anyone under 15 won't probably enjoy it as much as if you'd play it when you are older... Seriously, why buy this game for a 12 year old? its a very good and nice game, if you are mature enough to play it. I have to stress that this is darker than most of the MGS games, its not like MGS 2 or 3 which could be played by somewhat younger audience* SPOLER* someone said the game has ""just a little blood"" hmmm, there is a scene where you walk to a abandoned hospital that is basically covered in blood and people rotting to death plagued by the parasites. Just better if you trust the commonsense expert on this one and not the trolls who clearly have not paid attention while playing the gameBTW: It is not hating the game if i tell the facts that its NOT FOR KIDS, its RESPECTING the game by stating what is the reality of it! which is that this game was not intended for children! - Written by a young adult man, who actively plays videogames.",0
"Although this game has it's violence in it, such as being able to interrogate enemies for intel and some bloodshed, that's about all it has. There is a scantily clad character in it, you can make your horse deficate on command, and some other things, it's not nearly as bad as this site paints it to be. There's no rape, no over-the-top violence, and no excessive swearing. If your child can see a movie like Rambo or something, then this game is perfectly fine.",0
"Throughout my playthrough of metal gear solid v: the phantom pain, I had to fight and kill to survive, and yes, though there are several ways to avoid this, they are (at least until you can develope better non-kill weapons like sleep grenades and better tranquilzers for your handgun) much harder to use. This game is definitely not for children, and of this I can be sure. It deals with heavy topics such as mass genocide, the killing of children and innocents, and even having to fight child soldiers, to name a few things. That being said, I believe that as soon as is appropriate, you should get your kid this game. Fantastic gameplay, as intricate as it is entertaining, forces players to think their own ways In and out of sticky situations, and will help sharpen problem solving skills. The stark image of war serves as both a harsh reality and a learning experience, as even though Snake ultimately gets his revenge, he will never get back his arm, or his eye, both lost in war. Its a lesson on how empty getting revenge really can be. The game doesnt try to stear you in any one direction, as one feels as though one isnt really sure what you are fighting for or who snake can really even trust,and the only thing that is very clear is that war is hell. War is bad, and it ruins all who touch it. This is a fact heavily addressed throughout all of the solid series, and this game in particular pushes you to the idea of ""dust in the wind"", or that ultimately, war will go on forever as long as mankind remains so petty and evil, and what it was fought for will never really matter. While it will present this in a fairly depressing light, it will also therefore teach one to think for themselves, and not to get caught up in battles, literally or otherwise, just because somebody told then to, but instead to be skeptical of government, and to relize that no government is perfect, and all are corruptted at some level. Sorry about errors, typing on an iphone is hard.",0
this game has violence sex and lots of explosions and blood. i think that you should be mature or with an responsible adult.,0
"Profanity isn't too bad. Pretty typical for T/PG-13. There's just a lot of it. The sexual innuendo is a huge concern. Teach your kids to respect women and not to act like Nathan Drake, and it's fine",0
"This game would be appropriate for older teens and up due to the level of violence, mild language and some games in series have some dark areas. If you need a reference think about the series being on par with violence, themes, and language as Indiana Jones.
This game includes 3 games from the Uncharted Series. The series is about a treasure hunter searching for fabled legends. The gameplay mostly involves solving puzzles, and fighting enemies. The game does involve using stealth, guns, and hand to hand combat.
There is mild language throughout the game. There is violence and some blood, but nothing gory. Some games in the series involves facing off against creatures, and demon like monsters which are not intended to be frightening.
The series is amazing especially the 2nd game. It is like playing an action/adventure movies and has great storylines.",0
"If your kid is mature and doesn’t has problems when seeing violence or hearing some bad words, if he/she knows that DRUGS ARE BAD, knows that USA or any other country aren’t the “heroes” and knows how Latin America and Bolivia really are (I mean not everything is full of drugs and cartels) therefore your kid should be able to play this game without problems.",0
"great game can be very easy to play or you can make it very hard, it is very system intensive so make sure your computer can run it, there is alot of violence, blood sprays from opponents and splatters walls and vehicles, torture, drugs implanted in people, brief photos of corpses melting in acid, beheading, ability to kill opponents, corrupt police men and innocent bystanders also alot of swearing like f**k, s**t, f**king hell and weaker ones like damn, crap and s**tballs. Also cocaine feilds, references to weed and a cutscene of a man snorting multiple doses of cocaine. Users can play online and communicate with random people and they can purchase and spend in game currency with real money. Little sexual content though other than a drone being used to film a couple and a refernce to d**k pics.",0
"The live action and cutscene gore is severe in places, but nothing that most teens won't have seen elsewhere. Some of the soundtrack dialogue (that can't be filtered out) is fairly severe, too, such as a conversation in which a sadistic couple have a ""comic"" discussion about the size of the penis on the corpse of one of their torture victims, and in which the woman puts it in her mouth. Definitely not one for the kids.",0
"Combating cocaine is the main premise
Definetily has a ""fully exposed boob"" in a cutscene
Combat
Torture
Cursing
Crude Humor
On a personal note, I have and still do personally enjoy playing this game. You play as good American soldiers trying to combat a cruel druglord and as such much of the game is insanely violent with a ton of cruelty displayed by the gang. The players will come across torture chambers, suicides, and drug dens as someone actually fighting with a cartel would do. Great game and definetely mature.",0
"This is a great game I'm not going to lie. The only thing is that breasts are shown. If your child is one that watches all the content that you can find in the game AKA Kingslayer Files then that is the only way they will see the breasts. Other than that I feel like it is fine. There is also a lot of swearing, but kids hear that everyday in school. Some of it is comedic too. So, if you are fine with all of that then you should definitely pick up this game. It is also pretty long and really cheap.",0
"This game has a very interesting storyline that is very rewarding when it flushes out in the end. The graphics are amazing. To be honest, a younger kid could technically watch 90% of the game (when traversing the landscape and doing regular ""orders""), the other 10% just isn't good for them at all.
There are a few key areas where there is fights with guns, using a lethal gun on a human is a big no no. While killing is not prevented, it's best to avoid it as it will tack on a lot of extra time you could spend doing other things, cleaning up your mess... be a good ""porter"", don't kill stuff in this game.
That all said it's highly encouraged to use non-leathal weapons in the game to subdue humans. The ghosts called ""BT""s don't actually die but are passed on to the other world, when you defeat them using... Bodily fluids of all sorts.. yip it's wierd, but it guess it all ties in to the character.
On a positive note, I love how this game supports quite distinctly the intrinsic value of all human life regardless.
There is some areas where some of the characters swear a lot, but it's far and few between. You know the characters that do it more. There is blood in this game as well.
I thought I'd hate this game, some critics coined it as a walking simulation, but it's far from that. Yeah it's tougher in the start, but give it a chance and you will find that it only adds to the games emersion. It is not the gocha many people criticising it for without actually giving it a good go of it. After you've passed the first area and some, you will see.
I put 16+ here and not higher because there is no sexual content (except seeing Norman Redus' backside in the shower -skippable) and a girl in her underwear, but there are too scary and disturbing scenes for kids, a complicated storyline, swearing and violence.",0
"I LOVE this game. There is a lot of problem-solving and strategy, along with great engaging cut scenes (that can be skipped if you'd rather not watch them) and epic combat - demons, mages, dragons, and a multitude of other mythological creatures. There is some language, but nothing over-the-top. I've clocked nearly eighty hours of gameplay and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've heard the f-word. Sh*t pops up fairy frequently, but usually when you're out exploring regions with your team and not paying much attention to the banter anyway. As far as the sexual content, it's more implied than shown. Like, your character and their chosen romantic interest will be shown kissing and the screen will fade to black. In all my hours of playing, I have seen breasts (my character's) only once in a cut scene after a faded screen. Lots of fighting, but none of it is particularly graphic. It's a lot like Skyrim, another game I would have no problem with my hypothetical 13-year-old playing. Strong, conscientious characters, both male and female.",0
"DA inquisition is a massive fantasy role playing game, it is absolutely brilliant! Sex, blood, nudity and language can all be turned off, however these things aren't very bad to begin with, if you let your child play skyrim, fallout 4 or call of duty then this game will be fine for them",0
"I love this game
I think it has a good message for kids if you work together you can win
Just make sure they stay away form romances and you will be fine",1
"Let me start by stating that this game is amazing. It is a masterpiece of a game and I have enjoyed the countless hours I have spent playing it thus far. With that being said, this game should not be played by children or kids under 17. It is riddled with violence, swearing, and sex. There are completely nude scenes which infer sexual relations (both heterosexual and homosexual). The violence comes from slaying innocent wildlife, other humans (although ""bad guys""), and demons. There is a religious aspect to this game, but is completely fictional and belongs to the Dragon Age world. With that being said a mature young adult or adults will be able to handle all of these themes and see past them to realize and enjoy the truly wonderful experience of immersing oneself into the game.",0
Very amusing game with extremely long battles with titans and other creatures. Ok for children with a mature mind.,1
"I think it’s a good horror game, but you need to focus very much. It’s very terrifying, horrifying. That’s why I rated this game for 15+.",0
I think this is good game to teach your kid history of wars and gives it a good realistic idea of it.,1
The worst part about this game is the fact that you can stab people with shovels. While I understand that the developers should have added this as WWI was a gruesome war. The blood is minimal and only visible at a close range. The violence is what you would expect from a M game.,0
I think this game is really good and my son is only 10 years old and I watched him play it he can handle it really well.,1
"Battlefield 1 is a first person shooter set during World War I. The only major objectionable content in this game is the violence. When an enemy is killed, they occasionally will emit a small splash of burst before falling to the ground. However, due to the general chaos of the game, it is barely noticed. You can also stab and bludgeon enemies with knives and other melee weapon's. A small amount of blood is emitted or a small amount of blood will hit the screen. The most graphic part of these kills are the sound effects. The violence is still realistic without having masses of blood.
The swearing in the game in minimal and at one point in the campaign, a man is told not to swear.
Overall, this game has a fair amount of violence which is not over the top. It has much less than other popular first person shooter's. It does deal with themes such as death and war, but being a game set in WWI, this is to be expected. The general objectionable content is low and the game should be appropriate for teen's over the age of 13.",0
"My ten year old son plays this and it’s not as bad as you think.First I wasn’t sure, until I watched it and there wasn’t anything wrong.It’s sutible for age 10 and up.",1
"This game is amazing and well made! War stories are so much fun and has a lot of action and like how it gives you options for stealth for stealth gamers like me. Online is a bit boring at times but still fun to play. Graphics are amazing! Better than GTA 5 in my opinion. It is not a bad game like Battlefield 5 and there is barely things that cost money. There is lots of voilence and unlike Hitman 2, it wont let you knock out enemy but only kill which is reasonable considering this is World war one. There are bad words but only said every 20 mins which is great for teens and pre-teens and there is no mention of Sex. it ca n be difficult to learn the controls but easy after you mastered it.",0
This game is given an 18 in the UK. I believe that this is somewhat unjustified as it is not a mindless killing game such as GTA but has a proper message. Also because Batman has a non killing code the majority of low level crooks you fight just end up unconscious. Overall I would say any teenager who doesn't seem like they are a likely to dress up as a bat and go on a killing spree can handle this game.,0
"First of all buy this game it is REALLYYYYYYY awesome and I loved the whole experience! There is tons of profanity and violence to watch out for so be care full when considering giving it to kids. It really depends on what your limits are to violence and swearing.(these 2 things very prominent in this game) Batman often beats up criminals in ways only Batman-themed games can give you. (Punching, kicking gagging, throwing , headbutting, blowing up criminals with ""explosive gel"" Throwing Batarangs, and shooting them down with the Batmobile are only a couple of examples.) Players are rewarded with special combos and tools to take down criminals in even more violent ways than before. A fair amount of blood is included in some scenes, though not usually in combat. Swearing is also prominent in the game with Sh-t, b-itch, and a-hole all commonly used. While Sex isn't prominent in the game there is some characters who wear revealing clothing. Despite all that I still think this game doesn't deserve the fabled M-rating and should probably get the teen treatment instead.",0
"I am a professional PEGI reviewer and I mostly give reviews to video games in commonsense, maybe a few movies. This game is extremely violent. This game doesn't have the same amount of violence as the other games. It is much more severe. I seriously think that the violence should be 5/5. Common sense tends to give the same violence ratings as the previous games in the series so please don't fall for this violence rating. In my opinion, the violence rating is 8.3/10. Violence isn't even the biggest issue. If you want other games 9/10 violence, you have doom eternal, the ghost of Tsushima, and sekiro shadows die twice. There is quite a bit of sex in the game. There are many frequent sexual references and slurs. There are references to live nude girls, porn stars, and more... I think that the sex rating is 4.6/10. If you want games with 4/10 sex, you have... AC Odyssey, AC unity, and RDR2. There is also harsh language. F**k is rarely used. B*tch, sh*t, bloody, bastard, c*cksucker, p*ssy, d*ck, and the phrases: ""Son of a b*tch"", ""Are watching the nude girls, I am after this mission to hell""(all can be hard to hear unless in a cutscene, and etc, are used commonly. The main problem with the language is that the word, f*ggot is used the most commonly. The language is 6/10. This is the biggest issue(language). Games with around the same amount of language are AC origins, AC odyssey, Battlefield 1(2016). I have described this game in great detail. There is some smoking and drinking and etc. but that is brief and shouldn't be worth mentioning.",0
"The story contains mature themes including a teen girl exploring her sexuality and feelings for another teen girl in a non graphic way. It also contains songs which contain strong language which makes it M. How the story is told is interesting and the game can completed under 2 hours.
The game may seem at first like its a horror game because how dark the house is, but its not. The gameplay is fairly straight forward, walk around picking up stuff to figure out the story. The game is all about telling a story.",0
"Violence and Scariness: Scenes of typical bloodless superhero action violence, one (possible) upsetting character death. One scene in which alien bugs are fought off involves some purple goo, could be interpreted as blood, but not really graphic or intense.
Language: One use of moderate language: sh*t, occasional use of milder language: hell, crap, friggin'
Sex/Nudity: Mild flirting, a mild sex reference possible depending on dissisions.
Drugs: Some alcohol use, and scenes of drunkenness.",0
My 14 year old boy loves marvel and this was perfect there is little langue and onl a bit of action this is great,1
This is a very good game for people who want to be able to play a quality game without to much violence.,1
"This game is absolutely PERFECT for anyone who want themselves a good adventure. Skyrim delivers such adventures. Of course, like any Bethesda game, it’s a bit buggy but that adds to the fun. The little kids might find the more intense battles scary and such so it’s not recommended to let them play Skyrim. It’s more fitting for teens or anyone who can handle such things. It doesn’t have much in gore except for a few execution scenes such as the one at the beginning of the game and upon entering Solitude. You have the choice to basically choose your own adventures and as soon as your finished with the prologue you’re free to do as you wish! Overall an amazing game and I definitely recommend it!",1
"This game is so fun! It is if you are in Lord Of the Rings. It says there are things about sex and stuff, but I have played this with my son for hours and hours and not one thing about sex. Violence is not bad, just some jam on your lips is all. You can drink beer etc., but you have to buy it and their is a sign that says it is a bar so you can easily avoid it. I think any one from 10 years and up can play it",0
"The violence in this game is probably what a lot of people are worried about. But, it’s not that bad at all. I got this for my 13 year old son, and he has really been wanting it and I watched him start up the game. The game starts with a medieval beheading. But, the beheading is far away, so you can’t really even see it and it’s not that violent. Then, a dragon attacks and you need to escape the town. During the game, you are attacking mostly inhuman creatures such as, goblins, giant spiders, giants, etc.... When you are attacking them no visible wounds get on the creature, it just leaves some blood on your sword, there is not even blood splatter on the ground. If you get to a high enough level, you can do finishers. These are epic things you do to finish off the enemy. Some of them include impaling the creature with a sword or beheading them. But they look ridiculously fake. Sense the game is old, it looks really glitchy and it looks like the sword doesn’t even touch the creature. The blood just looks fake as well, it is really dramatic. I also don’t know what common sense is talking about with the rape and stuff. My son and I have explored the whole map and there is none in it. So, I think this game is good for 12 year olds and up. I have no clue why it was rated mature. And if you are a parent that is apprehensive about their teen/kid playing this, it should be completely fine.",0
"The ratings that are like 15+ or older is way to high.
This game can have some blood or gore but it’s just for realism.
Yes there is some sex related topics and images but it’s nothin they can’t handle.",0
"As long as your child is mature, I think this game is completely fine. I watched my son play it and saw almost nothing wrong, except some mild violence.",0
You need to be very mature to play the game,0
This game is a good game with a fairly good story but it is hard to understand it's also extremely violent and includes some disturbing images including the main character Lara burning the sun queen himicos body you also bash someone in the head and realistic blood shoots out. The blood also comes out when you shoot an enemy. It also includes some strong language including f--k and sh--t and bastard are all mutterd by the main characters and the side enemy's. Over all I think it's OK for any 12 year old it also makes you solve puzzles,0
I think your kids would have to be mature for this game it has lots of blood and dead body’s and skulls everywhere at the start of the game the r hung bodies with their head chopped off and wrapped up I have played this game and I am 11 I loved the game but some other kids may find it quite disturbing.,0
"If you let your kids play uncharted, the last of us, bloodborne, or call of duty, than there shouldn't be an issue here. If the last of us and uncharted had a baby, tomb raider will be born. this is because this game is about lara croft a young woman who raids tombs for treasure like Nathan drake in uncharted, and learns how to survive, like the last of us. There is no sex in this game or the sequels to this game like shadow or rise of the, no sex in any of them. This game is about lara surviving off an island and finding treasure. The violence is NOT over the top at all, its true u do kill enemies but never in gruesome close your eyes moments, there is no ripping hearts or heads. if u let your kids watch tv-ma, than this is the same. You'll see corpses of blood like in Arkham knight but nothing gory at all. this game is great and advise it to 13+",0
"I remember playing the Tomb Raider series a decade ago and being completely enthralled with the puzzles, tombs, switches, action, and excitement the game offered. Now that I have a son, I was super excited to see it was available for PS4. I purchased the game and played through it before allowing him to have a go at it. Upon completing the game, I immediately took it out and placed it on 'Dad's shelf'. The graphics were awesome. The game play is a bit different than I remembered, but still a lot of fun. The foul language and violence however, caused it to be an 'adult only' game in our house. Completely inappropriate for children as it teaches them it's ok to use foul language in normal everyday situations. Maybe it's just us, but we don't use that type of language in our house, and I don't want my son learning it from a video game. What ever happened to just having fun? Anyway, I loved it, but my son has a few years to go before he's ready to be exposed to it.",0
"Its great. The atmosphere, detailed environments, are a joy to explore and relic hunt in, the addictive and well paced progression, the eureka moments with puzzles, Uncharted like explosive setpieces with viscerality that is helped with the M rating and excelent gunplay make this must buy! The story is rather pedestrian,predictable, typical Indy fare (not on Last Crusades level but a little above Temple of Doom's) but Lara is likable throughout and the player vies for her evloution into a survivor and a warrior.
That said the game is kind of a gore fest. Granted its not constant like say Gears or Prototype but still frequent even in exploring areas. Blood and bone spray with each hit in great quantities with vivid sounds and later on graphic executions (Lara also apparently has adopted Nathan Drakes sociopathy). Several scripted scenes show bloody stabings and shootings (Laras 1st kill is very graphic and Traumatic for her. Shattered skull and torn flesh visible as the the killed gurgles his last). A monsters feeding chample is adorned with graphicaly mutilated hanging nude bodies (only posteriors visible) and entrails makes up for the lack of furniture. A kill pit, initiation chamber is similarly adorned, and we see starved insane tortured souls suffer in thier cages raving madly. This is also after Lara swims her way thru a river of blood and corpses. Many rotting corpses seennin a shanty town and we see a fresh one thron into a pit into the players view after some disturbing slashing and gurgling noises. Yet another gore temple in the last chapter. There are also graphic player death animations like having head crushed by a falling rock, getting your throat slit or being impaled thru the neck on a tree branch. 44 F words (dialog and audio logs combined).",0
Bloody fantasy violence for teens.,0
I would never want my kid playing this game due to the over the top language throughout every single conversation in the game. They must have thought they really wanted to make a statement with how many times the F word can be used in a video game that's targetted to teens and adults. Call of Duty and Battlefield games all seem to do well with realistic language....,0
"I'll admit it isn't the best game for kids. There's gore, swearing, and the likes. However it's still a very well written game that I love.
Spoilers ahead
You've been warned
I saw someone else post sometimes like ""whaaat? Richard killed himself?"" But he didn't, Trinity killed him.",0
"Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a game not for kids but teens 13 and older shouldn’t have a problem with it. Coming from a Christian family I was scared to let my boys (12 and 14) get this game. After reading about it and learning about it I decided to let them buy it. I decided to watch them for a bit and even try the game out for myself just to see how bad it was. Suppressingly this game relied a lot more on puzzle solving then violence. You do kill people but there bad. There’s also some language but that can be disabled from the settings. Lara Croft is also a very good role model, same goes for many other charectors in this game. After learning all of this I decided to let my kids keep the game. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is ok for teens 13 and older.",0
"very horrendous,, horrific and gruesome, character react unrealistically, and about three or four of them is very abusive, racist, and pornographic. Plots can easily drive you to suicide.",0
"Unlike the past 2 games, V3 can be pretty intense towards younger viewers. There's a lot of heavy plot points, some overly sexual tones/ suggestive themes, and much more violence.
I would highly recommend your child to wait until they are either mature enough to handle these certain themes, or when they are 18 and over.",0
"This game is not suitable for kids under 12. The reason for that is the game is Violent has blood but the game is Good Nice story, better than the one from the last game. There is some swearing in the game, Like Sh*t. there is no type of sex in the game but there is sexual content no nudity. There is a lot of violence This is a fighting game what do you expect?
There is a little bit of killing in the start of the game ""Robin"" Kills an inmate
By using a knife slicing his neck. but it wont show him slicing his neck, brainiac minions Kill people very brutal when you finish a fight it does not kill them they just get knocked out.",0
This is one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life. The gameplay is simple yet difficult. The armors and monsters all look fantastic.,1
"While God of War used to be an ultra-violent and gory video game series, the latest entry has changed a lot. Not only has the violence been toned down a lot, but the game now has a more mature storyline. In the first few games, players were tasked with hunting down gods from Greek mythology and killing these deities out of hate. God of War 2018, on the other hand, features a main character who wants to scatter his wife's ashes with his son. Kratos (the protagonist) seeks redemption for the violence he has committed.
The content is still violent, but decidedly less so. There is no drinking or use of substances. There is some minor swearing, such as b****, but any bad language is kept to a minimum. There are no sexual scenes.",0
Very good story and gameplay,1
It's a fun game and I think it's a harmless with a bit of swearing but otherwise fine,1
"The game does have killing but NEVER humans just monsters. As a die hard god of war lover, I can tell u this is good for ages 13+ because its not super violent as the other god of war games where all u do is kill people for vengeance and have sex with women for points. in this game (the latest god of war) there is no sex AT ALL, its not about killing people for hate, just monsters in order to finish kratos duty as a father to mentor his son into not being like his old self, and that's really it. The kills for monsters are NOT gory as people think, there is rarely any gore shown when u kill monsters and even when u do, its not extreme at all, its mild gore tv-ma level, this is nowhere near mortal kombat or bloodborne gore. There is no ripping hearts and heads off, u just kill monsters/creatures with axes and arrows. The game doesn't teach about war its just a father and son bonding moment for kratos with his kid.",0
"for all ages, fantastic game with a different but still fantastic story line.",1
"Its a great game that I think anyone above the age of 13 could play if they don't scare too easily and really love horror games! It does get a little violent at times, and honestly they say really bad words super frequently, but if your kid it relatively fine with all that they'll love this game",0
"Parents need to know that this game includes lots of blood and Gore when shooting the werewolves and zombies. They can be dismembered and decapitated from a first person perspective if you shoot them in the right place. Also, there is some swearing. 14 uses of the f word and a couple uses of sh-t.",0
"Resident Evil: Village is the 8th main installment in the RE (resident evil) franchise and one of the scariest.
VIOLENCE:
In the opening minutes of the game, a woman is suddenly shot repeatedly in her dining room, then finished off with a pistol showing blood spray but minimal detail. The scene is less graphic than shocking, and takes place in a dimly lit environment.
During the course of the game, many corpses with blood pools under them, bloody faces etc. are shown, however graphic wounds are almost never shown.
Throughout the game, your character ensures several forms of torture viewed from a first person perspective. These include the protagonist getting his hand and fingers bitten in half, getting his hand cut on barbed wire, getting his wrists and hands bitten repeatedly by werewolves, getting suspended on hooks stabbed in his hands and then torn off, getting his entire hand sliced clean off and then put back on, getting mauled on the stomach by a massive werewolf, getting his head smashed against the floor, getting hurled around, getting his heart ripped out and crushed along with death animations showing him getting eaten, impaled, crushed or obliterated. Note that this makes up the most graphic violence in the game and is shown from a first person perspective, so it is much less graphic than it sounds. Despite this, blood is still shown most of the time.
Several people are killed in a house, but detail is limited.
In combat, you face mystical creatures and monsters including dragons, creatures, werewolves, robots and zombies. When targeting the heads of zombies or werewolves they can be shot off showing blood.
You stab a monster woman in the chest, but she turns into a dragon before it kills her.
At a certain point you must swim in a basement filled with blood and zombies.
A large, disturbing fetus/baby chases after you for a tiny portion of the game.
Overall, the violence is quite tame for an M rated game, due to most of the violence being obscured by the first person view.
LANGUAGE:
Infrequent language includes around 14 uses of “f*ck” over the 8+ hour game time, some use of “sh*t” and one use of “pr*ck”.
Mild, tame language for its time to play.",0
Good for young player,1
"Resident Evil Village is the latest of the Resident Evil franchise, where it has the usual horror you’d expect. The game is violent, as you’d expect, especially considering that the entirety of it is viewed in first person, where most of the blood and gore can be seen clearly. There is some language as well, some role models are there, although not really the best types, and the game is easy to play, but you need to think regarding puzzles in the game.",0
"Beautiful, I can’t waiting for A new One, you can buy the game without thinking",1
"It's really well made and I think any teen could appreciate the quality. It's really gory, and has a bit of language but I don't care if my older teens play video games like that.",0
"This game is beautiful in every interaction. I loved how when I played it alone and when my son played it with me. It showed how much we think the same but also showed some differences between us. He liked playing as a more moral character than me. I liked The twist of being more evil(this is always how it’s been in RPGs for me,) we both got different endings to the game. I thought that was really amazing. It really is wonderful how much games have changed in my lifetime. In conclusion this is a great game it may be violent and vulgar at times but it tells a great narrative. I really loved it!",0
"THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR KIDS THAT SAY THIS NOT A BAD GAME
It was rated mature for a reason. There are dead bodies in a body bag everywhere in the city. I recommend you don't get your kid this game",0
My son loves it!,1
"my son loves this game, he says it is amazing and the weapon customization is great whatever that means!",1
"I'm not sure why the reviews say 11-13 and up. The amount of bad language alone makes it at least 16 and up. The violence is there but it isn't horrible like heads exploding or anything like that. I think the language plays more of a negative role then the violence, but that's just my opinion. This came with my sons Xbox One but I haven't downloaded it because of the language, it's unnecessarily excessive. Like bad language is the cool thing to do, it seems a lot of games are doing this nowadays when ultimately if they took that language out it would not change the gameplay in any way.",0
"It's a very good game right off the bat. If one we're to play the game for a few hours, they would gain knowledge of the controls. Some things parents should know: there is a ""Dark Zone"", where players can open roam, with other players. It's an open-mic world, but they can just as easily mute all the players. Secondly, in single-player mode, there are hints of vulgarity, such as ""F*ck"" and ""Sh*t"" but they aren't said with enough intensity and often enough, for a child to catch on. The game, has no sexual entendu's or sex symbols, so that's a plus. On top of that, the role models, are less than great, but still provide a strong moral sense of security. No drinking/smoking, but there are nods towards Heroin. Not ""too much"" consumerism, although there never really is ""too much"". The violence, is prevalent, although there's barely any blood and gore.",0
"The rating is only given because of language. The violence is standard for a 16 but it's been bumped up to an 18 because of the language. This is because of an egoistic approach of being cool for playing an 18 rather than a 16. The gameplay is honestly nothing to worry about. Yes, there are bodies in the street and people fighting but to be honest, you don't notice them because of the gun battles so frequently encountered",0
My son has so much fun playing this! For 10 maybe 9 and under.,1
"Inside is an exceptional narrative minimalist side-scroller with unobstructive beatable puzzles, wrapped up in an unrivalled inhuman atmosphere. A truly unique cinematic experience everyone should play",1
"This game is truly a must buy for tweens mature enough to handle the struggles that Lara Croft goes through. I think that the biggest no-no of this game is its strong use of profanity. Characters drop f bombs and s words many times, and also many other words too. The kills are plain brutal, there is even this skill that you master where you get a gun and finish a person violently. Though, right now, I would like to focus on the story side of this game. The game itself revolves around Lara Croft as she attempts to finish the mystery that her supposedly suicidal father began. She has to overcome nature, immortal beings, and the soldiers of an organization named Trinity. There is one last thing that I would like to say. Throughout the whole campaign, Lara builds strong friendships and almosg loses a friend. All while staying positive. Lara is a great role model for everyone, she teaches everyone a huge lesson on positivity.",0
This game is still violent but other than that it is much better than the other ones. This game does use s--t a lot and it sometimes uses f--k but not as Much as the other ones I say if your kid wants to play one let them play this one,0
"Great game, if a little violent at times. Strong language used, as the main character drops f and s bombs occasionally. No nudity (which is a nice change from the usual topless girls scene) and it is a fantasy based game. Like I said, a great game, just know your child.",0
"This game can be very violent, and contains many repetitions of swear words that are standard to a Call of Duty campaign. Multiplayer is more tame, and zombies can be frightening to younger children. No sexual content, but there is still a “content filter” as it is called in game, that can be toggled to completely avoid any sexual or “graphic content” which is a staple of these games, which I’m really happy about.",0
"Game can be violent at times, but that’s to be expected from a Cod game. Decent amount of swearing, but that’s limited to campaign. No sexual content at all, unless you are counting the game’s “calling cards” which are only used in multiplayer, can be a bit suggestive, but can be hidden with graphic content filter. Would recommend young kids skip out because of violence.",0
"The gore level is relatively high but appropriate for a WW2 setting. Not as brutal as World at War or Black Ops though. If you've seen Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge youll be fine. Theres your dismemberments, heads bursting, fellas cut in half and ample amounts of blood. Flame attacks dont do much body damage tho. But like most COD games there is a toggle off for the violence. Campaign is as basic and soulless as it gets both in level design and story. Zombies is prob the worst ever. I dont care about MP so whatever. Just bring on Modern Warfare 2-II",0
"The sexual themes is once again just like fear 2- naughty ol' alma shows her breasts. for language, there is a pretty big wide variety or uses of f*** and s****. violence- people are torn apart everywhere",0
"The rating ""mature"" can be applied to any game with a gratuitous amount of violence, cursing, or sex, but Catherine is an M-rated game with a difference: It actually IS mature. It deals with many real-life situations, such as infidelity, obsession, and alcoholism. Series of questions are presented to you through the game (like ""Can love exist without pain?"") and your answers will determine where you fall on a morality meter pointing towards ""Law"" (commitment, monogamy) and ""Chaos"" (a devil-may-care, sleep-around lifestyle.) It determines which girl you'll end up with, as well as what will happen to the protagonist as well.
The game has a lot of language and sexual innuendos. The violence is present, not terrible, though images of men's corpses in their beds are quite frightening, as are the level bosses. However, the climactic scene culminates in a stabbing, with a large blood puddle running from the body.
There are also religious undertones. A painting in the ""confessional"" where you answer questions features the protagonist crucified to a Venus symbol, and in later levels, a crowd of sheep gathers around him. There are also copious references to Assyro-Babylonian mythology. Such tie-ins create an almost hallowed atmosphere that further enhances the game's dark and serious nature.
The game pushes the boundaries of being a game in the first place and quickly gets under the player's skin and into his head. In the game's opening sequence, a sheep falls through midair onto a cutout of the ""double-Catherine"" stamp, landing with a bloody splat. It then cuts to Vincent (the protagonist), crucified to a tower of blocks with barbwire, as his girlfriend sits above him . He turns his head to the player, as if to break the fourth wall, and shouts, ""CATHERINE!"" His cry for help sucks you in - and you didn't even press start.
Once you do, however, the game alternates between animated sequences - beautiful cel-shaded snippets of the story - and the nightmare sequences, which involve moving blocks around in order to climb to the top. I've heard many complaints that the game is frustrating. And yes, it is. If you're especially dexterous you can pick it up in a heartbeat. There is also a ""Super Easy"" patch that was added to the game due to Atlus recognizing the complaints of Japanese players.
It's deep, it's dark, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's completely insane: delightful in its whimsy and stark in its veracity, Catherine is an experience. It is like nothing you've ever played before and few games are likely to match it. This is, hands-down, one of the best games ever created, and I've been playing since my NES days.",0
"Parents need to know that this game does not particularly overtly objectify women. The choices the player makes honestly do make Vincent what he is in the game: there wouldn't be eight endings if his personality weren't flexible. Most, if not all, of the sexual content isn't much past what you would view in a PG-13 movie. The violence is a bit intense since Vincent does disappear in a splash of blood and bones in many death sequences and the language is definitely coarse, however. It does exhibit positive role models: Vincent (depending on the choices the player makes) and, to a certain extent, Katherine. The game is loaded with real life problems (and, of course, some not-so-real ones, being an Atlus game) such as pregnant girlfriends and alcohol abuse. I am not a parent, but I do believe that this is not a bad game to exhibit to those ages 16 and up to not only entertain them (trust me, it's a brilliant game with lots of charm and challenge), but also inform them of how to enter correct situations and avoid bad ones.",0
"If you're like me and you're a mature teenager/adult, this game is awesome. Creative storyline and gameplay, somewhat good story-wise...I know I'd play it again. Should you let your ten year old son/brother play it? Not ever. There's a reason this game's rated M, and that's because its not aimed at children. There's blood, gore, swearing...the whole game's a tournament organized to determine the best assassin out there. Not to mention the sex...it's definitely there, even if they only show a little cleavage or an upskirt, it's got a lot in the dialogue. But like I said, if you're a mature, responsible individual who can actually buy this game legally, it's good. Just not for the young 'uns.",0
"This game puts the players in a post-apocaliptic world, filled with disfigured alien figures and dehumanized survivors. The main character is fighting to protect his family and save the world, but his methods are questionable, that doesn't make him a good role model.
- The violence is very gory: Players can use fire bottles to burn their enemies and even a sledgehammer to dismember their bodies (There's a lot of blood and screams).
- Enemies can pop out of nowhere in the dark, Which could be scary for some. The cutscene's also shown decapitations and a lot of profanity.
Plus the fact that the educational content is zero, and the game is very big, I wouldn't recommend it for kid's and teen's, this game is for adults only!",0
"First off, this game is violent. Shotguns blow the fronts off enemies, head hosts make entire heads explode, and persistent fire will reduce enemies to giblets. However, with the exception of a single chapter all of this is directed against an evil alien species, and in that chapter you fight brutal former prisoners. The gameplay is really fun with medkits instead of regenerating health, some of the coolest weapons I've ever played with in video games, and a story that takes you through post-alien apocalypse America to meet a variety of well rounded characters.",0
"There is strong language throughout including some F-bombs during the cutscenes. Violence is always a part of gameplay, and in some cases the player will be forced to attack or kill other humans during the story, it's not all zombies. There is no restriction on the use of guns but they adopt a secondary role in the gameplay. Also to note is the use of weapons such as brass knuckles and ""butterfly"" knives, which are considered illegal in most countries. All These elements are coupled with copious amounts of blood, but very little gore. With that being said, the playable characters are ethnically diverse and their purpose is one of good intentions. The player is tasked with keeping people safe and alive by any means necessary. During the story, players will assist a lifeguard station, a church, stranded villagers in the jungle, and even some ""born-again"" prisoners by bringing them food, water, and other means for survival. The zombie apocalypse merely serves as a backdrop for bringing these unique characters together to form a tight unit and push themselves to become better than who they were before the outbreak. By the time the player is ready to start a new game, they are thinking more about who they have helped rather than who they have killed. I think this is a powerful message and a much more important theme than most video games tend to embody. Even with the violence, there is much to be learned from what this game has to offer and I would recommend safe for any children with a mind for thinking outside the box.",0
"This gory zombie slasher is a very great game for people who like FPS ( first-person-shooter ) games. Dead island has a lot of violence and blood and some gore, but the gore isn't a lot. The swearing is extremely I mean extremely high. Almost every sentence you hear there will be a curse word or two. The violence is your everyday zombie game. The swearing contains f*ck s*it bi*tch and some other ones. The main story is very interesting and good. You have choices to help people in danger or they need something etc. you are able to drink alcohol etc. there is a little bit of sexuality but it's not to bad. I recommend this game to a mature 14+",0
"This is one game (ok it's technically 2 games) you don't want to play around your kid, parents, or girlfriend. Excessive violence and nudity with a sex minigame in both of the 2 games. But that doesn't mean it's not a fun game. With solid gameplay and impressive graphics (for 2 psp games imported onto the PS3) it also has a surprisingly good story behind all the gore. Chains of Olympus tells events that happened right before the original GoW and Ghost of Sparta adds in filler for between GoW and GoW II. While not essential to play, they add a lot to the series and are still really fun. Most times I don't agree with Commons Sense media's reviews in regards to positive role models but they were right on in this case. Kratos is an anti-hero who kills anyone or anything in his way. The only possible positve message here is in Ghost of Sparta where he risks his life to save his brother from the god of death Thanatos.",0
"First off: Yes, this game is as hard as you hear it to be, for me it was even harder. But you'll need to get over it to enjoy this game.
Violence: Pretty moderate. You can slash enemies with a sword, which results in some blood coming out of them. The most blood I could find was with a Hydra miniboss (which is completely optional and you don't even have to fight it), where you have to cut off each Hydra's head, but even that wasn't very graphic. Furthermore, you can turn off all blood in the settings, so I'll just move to...
Sex: About midway into the game you will encounter a boss fight with a woman's topless upper body attached to a gigantic spider, with only her hair covering up her nipples. In the cutscene you get a close up shot of her moving her body quite sexually in your direction, but you can skip the cutscene. Other nudity includes a harpie (a woman's body attached to an eagle's, with wings as arms) slightly visible naked butt in an optional location.
Overall: This is a fantastic game that can teach you a lot of lessons, from persevering through hard times to cooperating with friends. The vague lore and cryptic hints keeps the game on your mind, adding to the extreme satisfaction of beating a boss you were stuck on for a week. So yes, all the hype around this game is real.",0
"This game is brutal. Brutally difficult, that is! And violent. Violently entertaining! But yeah, it is a bit violent. Blood (which can be turned off) spurts around. Not to much actual gore, though. One character relies on her hair to cover her breasts. Not breast hair, though, so... yay? I really love this game, though.",0
"While Dark Souls is a fairly violent game featuring blood and some gore (the amount of which is grossly overstated in the official review), I'm giving a 14-up as the main issue here isn't with the content but rather the difficulty.
It's a fantasy action RPG without any objectionable content save for the violence and perhaps some subtle undertones. Anyone old enough to learn how to play it should be able to no differently than playing something like Zelda, and I figure the mean is probably 14 or so.
I have literally nothing to check box-wise because there aren't ""not particularly easy to play/use"" or ""lack of role models/overt messages"" options. I've checked the message one just because the game is so great, and to be fair, there is a lesson about perseverance/gittin gud to be learned here.
An aside: this game has no sexual content. Anyone who thinks cleavage is cause for concern needs to get outside and get a breath of fresh air, perhaps stop being so afraid of their own body parts.",0
"dark souls is a game were you kill demons, skelletons, and dark nights and more this game is very violent and there is one boss fight were there is a topples girl who is like a demon you have to fight this is not for kids i recomend 17 an older",0
"This is battlefield 3. here is what i expected, blood gore, EXTREME violence, guts. Here is what I got! everyone got an experience like no other this game is truly based on teamwork it is the main aspect of this game. There are also tons of missions including, capturing bases, taking down enemy jets, and blowing up tanks. This game is not very violent (no knifing). This particular content is playable for ages 11-12.",0
hello people this game is good because kids gotta learn that war may be fun on video games but its not in real life and thats good to teach them that when there in to the army.,1
I recommend 14+ good game good story it really has everything a game needs,1
the game has violence like cod and gta but in my opinion as long as you know it's fake it's fine the language is ok not bad and their is nudity but it's pixeled out and there are sexual jokes but other wise I think 12 years old is when you can play it,0
"I'm a christian parent, Flat out this is the reason this is M. Playdough blood, alien killing, super powers blood when you hit the ground. I swear this game has the same amount of violence as the avengers! 11 and up!!!!",0
I love this game so does my kid we have fun togathor playing it,1
"This game is VERY violent, you can shoot enemies heads off, chop your enemies bodies in half with a minigun and snap enemies necks with a quick but cruel execution move. Although there is a ton of violence, there is little detail and not huge amounts of blood, which makes this suitable for no child under 13. The language is strong and plentiful, but nothing a 13 year-old wouldn't have heard before.",0
"SEX/NUDITY - There is some sensuality and passionate kissing in one scene, where two characters make out on a bed (no nudity). One scene gives the player the opportunity to go into a back alley with a man to perform sex, in order to get money for food; she gets on her knees, implying she would perform oral sex, however she refuses anyway before anything can actually take place. In refusing, the man gets annoyed and demands that she is going to ""take it"", otherwise threatening that he will ""get real mad"". Before anything else can happen, her linked supernatural being intervenes by strangling the man, and the main character escapes. There is some very mild nudity in a couple of shower scenes, although it is in no way sexualised nor explicit in its portrayal, mainly showing bare backs. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are sequences of strong violence throughout the gameplay and cutscenes. While much of the violence is more action-orientated (hand-to-hand combat scenes, action set pieces) and has less emphasis on the strength of the violence, there are some stronger moments where the violence is more disturbing and shocking, or has bigger emphasis on the infliction of pain and injury. An example of these stronger moments include a torture scene, where a character is cut with a knife on the arm, and it is heavily implied his eye is gouged out with a knife. While lacking in explicit detail or gory visuals, there is still some sight of blood and the whole scene is very intense. Another example is when your linked entity possesses a soldier to commit a mass shooting on a group of government officials in a foreign country: there is more emphasis on bloody impact detail than other moments of violence. Furthermore, another example is when a group of homeless people (one of whom is the main character) are threatened and attacked by a gang of thugs wielding baseball bats, and the leading member knocks out the main character. He also hits her again while she is incapacitated, and a pool of blood can be seen around her head. Other moments of strong violence include shootings and stabbings with limited bloody detail. There are also sequences of supernatural violence when beings from another realm torment the main character. PROFANITY - There is strong language (""f*ck""), and milder terms used throughout. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - There is some drug misuse when players have the opportunity to smoke marijuana at a party, which causes the character to feel light headed. There is also sight of alcohol consumption, and one character is mildly depicted as an alcoholic. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent scenes of strong threat throughout, including some psychological threat and supernatural horror. There is also an element of sadistic threat in the interrogation scene. The entire game is very suspenseful, and also emotionally intense, and contains some mature themes. In addition, there are some points where the player can attempt suicide, such as the character finding a knife and beginning to cut her wrists (brief bloody detail) before being stopped, as well as attempting to jump off a bride into a busy road where she is again stopped before anything can occur. The theme of suicide is briefly touched upon in some scenes.
15 - Suitable only for persons aged 15 years and over. Contains strong content, and is not recommended for playing by any person below the age of 15.",0
"Same old teen drama stuff, if you’re kid knows about I think they are fine playing it to be honest",1
"There is very occassional use of strong language, and a couple of sex scenes with very limited nudity. Other than that, this is basically very similar to a superhero movie or TV show. It touches on some difficult themes and issues such as bullying, homelessness, and CIA's covert military operations, which your kids may not understand or even pick up on. But it certainly isn't unsuitable for them to play it.",0
"Well, this game is cool because when I was a kid I used to LOVE Robin Hood and the main chatacter Garrett is so much like him, only he keeps his items he steals. It's not a good role model because of stealing, violence, and sex. There's a lounge where u can CLEARLY see naked men and naked women having sex. For kids who can't handle violence, this isn't the game for u because of bows, guns, and whipping rods and fights. There also is a lot of language.",0
This is a great game. I have an eleven year old son. At first I was not sure he should get it it but he got the game for free on gold and I had him let me play it. I all really depends on how you want to play the game. You can see topless women if you do privacy invasions but other than that there is no sex. You can listen to swear words in cut scenes but if you mute it there is no swearing. And you control how much gun violence is in the game. You can get drunk or not. If you have a mature child it is a perfect game for them. And they can play with there friend who have the game and they can't play with other people pulses they invite them to the same party. Overall I think it is a great game and I think it receives to much hate from everyone.,0
"Great videogame.A good GTA 5 alternative for kids with age of 15-16.This video game contains intense violence, you can also kill innocent people as well as cops and your enemies. You can steal your favorite car or bike.You can hack different things.Like hack the traffic signal and make an accident spot or hack an ATM and take out some money.Use of words like f++k,sh+t,p+++y and c++t.Your character can also drink bear wine and other alcoholic drinks after which the screen goes blur for some time. There is only one scene that shows top less women.I won't suggest this game for someone under the age of 16.It made me laugh when I saw parents rating this game 12 and 14 and 13 and saying it is ok for them.I my self only allowed my 16 year old son play it and didn't allowed my 13 year old son.",0
this game is brilliant!!!!,1
"The only real problem would be violence, you kill a lot of people and there's a lot of swear words. But actually Aiden Pearce is a good guy, he kills bad guys. But you can kill innocent people but then your reputation goes down. And there's barely any sex only one mission but you can't see the parts and it's a cut scene so you can skip it. And as of drinking it's only one mission and there's no drugs.",0
This game is fine if you have ANY trust in your kids. I got it for my 9 year old and watched him play. This game is fine,1
It's very fun your child won't get bored it will keep them busy for a while. Trust me this is one of the best experiences on xbox,1
"It is a wonderful game, but your child may encounter some sexual stuff.",0
this is good role model for my kid and he loves riding the dirt bikes. If you are stuck residing if your kid should play this game it is a good role model.,1
"Very Violent, Lots of swearing, sex acts, nudity, drug use, and alcohol use. Not for kids but a really good game.",0
This game has partial nudity and bad language and a lot of smoking and its a okay for a teenager but not a child under 13 and a lot of violence and its its a rated M game.,0
To Start off the main reason its rated M is because on some maps like on Club House there is a room full of cocaine its in a boxes container it took me a couple months to realize what it was and on other maps there are bongs and other things but they get broke by other players in the first 30 seconds. On certain maps there are stripper led signs these are not that graphic and on Kafe Discovery in the kitchen there is a painting which has a naked woman on it. It is very hard to see the painting the player has to go out of their way to look at it and if they do its in black and white. This is one of the truly skilled games so your kid doesn´t need your credit card after they buy the game but like always there are things called elite skins where they have to use real money to buy. There are at the time of date there are about 30 operators on each sides Offense and Defense. Every Operator has a different ability and some of them work together with each other. Every Operator has a price you can either pay real money or play the game and get something called Renown. The operators price from 1000 renown (15 min-1 hour grind) to (25000 Renown 1 week grind of 8 hours every day) and every season 2 more operators come out. You need to know the maps well to play the game really well but that comes with time. Language wise there are lines for certain operators that have cursing like Thermite says Time to make a big f***ing hole and Hibana says As my friend says time to make a big f***ing hole in the wall and Iana says Damn if her gadget gets destroyed some operators say s*** when they get hurt these lines are not able to be switched out for other lines they have no rotation system they come out of no where. This game has great teamwork morals and a great way how to learn strategies and you notice all the security cameras in a room. I give this game 10/10 and great for 10+ that want a challenge.,0
This game is good for ten and up since it has barely any immature language and my son has not changed at all from playing this game,1
It is a fine game and I let my 10 year old son play it and he is doing fine in life,1
"Brutal swordplay and moderate gore (dismemberment is mostly to creatures/animals). Otherwise no mature content. Exceptional RPG build mechanics, robust combat and rewarding exploration. What it lacks in Skyrim's storytelling and accessibility it easily makes up for in gameplay depth and fun.",0
"Amazing game, I think it’s fine for tweens. No bad messages not many good ones either but really good game all together. No worse than lord of the rings",1
"“There's not much of a story and even less character development“
Clearly common sense media has no idea what they are talking about.",1
This game encourages you to perservere and not give up and there is an option to switch off gore,1
"A game who is notorious for its extreme difficulty, and alright Middle Ages themes. If your an extreme Christian who shoves god or Jesus into everything, you will not like this game at all, since it has themes of “witchcraft” if you believe in that. However, I played myself and found to be in wide disbelief of this games M-Rating. The blood is practically halo style, you attack, splatter out, then it goes into the floor. Horror themes are presented too, but since my 2 kids 13-16 already know fiction from reality, it is fine in my book. The game is practically an hard grind with a sense of pride on every boss you defeat, and it rather gives the player the meaning of preservation and holding onto something. Violence is overall high, but not Doom style. It’s just swords and bows, nothing of too much concern.",0
"There are references to child slavery; a brief glimpse of a first person flashback where one of the main characters (who is a 13 years old minor) are tortured and mutilated, to almost the point of dying. An adult secondary antagonist sexually harasses one of the main characters, who is a 16 years old minor.
At least two portrayals of catcalling, use of tobaco and explicit murder.",0
"Well Its Pretty Violent But A lil of intense violence when you shoot those bad guys in the head

"Language: Mild
Sex: Strong Nudity
Violence: Some
Other: Strong Horror",0
"Sex and Nudity: 7/10
This game is one of the few to display full frontal male nudity
There are corpses stripped of clothing
Some of The creatures in this game are wearing revealing clothing, aprons that show their buttocks, or nothing at all
One of the antagonists is completely naked
There are disturbing paintings of torture devices with nudity female and male
Violence and Gore: 9/10
This games violence pales in comparison to other mature horror games, and even though this is true, it is still enough violence to make it for older teens
It is implied that Alexander and Daniel tortured people to stop the shadow, there are remenants of these devices
There is a section where you have to throw severed body parts to distract a creature, they look very graphic and detailed
When Daniel, Justine, or Oswald gets hit blood appears on the screen
This game's enemy design is disturbing as well as bloody
Overall the violence is depicted, albeit not detailed.
Language: 6/10
Infrequent uses of F**k, and S**t as well as other profane words
drugs and alcohol: 0/10
None
Scariness and intensity: 10/10
This game is known for being one of the scariest games ever made. So expect a lot of horror/Jump scares/ intensity
The water monster segment is known as the scariest horror game moment ever.
Overall, this game is for older teens or people who can handle the gore and scarier",0
"I’ll get to the mature content after I point out a few key things, first off, I was extremely skeptical when my son asked to get this game, he said “Dad it’s free on my PlayStation!” I decided to play it before him and wow, this game is very fun. It is a puzzle, scare filled adventure. Let’s start with the violence. Violence is extremely scarce in this game. When you are hit by one of the monsters a bloody scratch will occur on your screen and the borders of your screen will go red. The only gore present is in the environment, the castle is littered with arms hanging by a chain, or torsos in an Iron Maiden. These body parts can be fed to an invisible water creature, but the creature eating it is not shown. There is only one scene of direct violence and it is when your character Daniel, drills a man’s chest. This happens a distance away, and no animation, all you see is a spurt of blood in the distance. Sexuality is the only other major factor. The corpses in the castle are naked at times, mainly only buttocks’ are present, but I saw slight frontal male nudity at one point. This game is ok, for a 12 year old but I’d say wait until they’re 13. The heavy themes of what horrible things have happened are only seen by the corpses. I hope this helped parents.",0
"This is very violent, but it is fun and it need a lot of good teamwork.
When you play as survivor you need to be good at working as a team
In order to survive. The game is bloody and violent, but very fun, i haved played this game many times, and every time i play this it had been a fun time with my friends.
I think that someone that is 10 years old can handle this.",0
I think they have done PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR! ;D,1
"One of the best games you will ever play, brutal, scary and mature, this game is a must play for gamers who like engaged / strategy games. Abords mature subjects matters but is quite realistic in that",0
"Very fun, addicting, and a well made game.",1
people say it has strong language but your wrong this game doesnt have profanity its ok for children 12 and up but it is too violent .but the thing is that they say the f-word maybe 1 time and its an awsome game .if you can trust your kids to not use bad language then they can play it,0
"Okay, nothing with a normal game I saw the comments, but the violence is high",0
"My son asked me if he can have the game,,mafia 2,, so I searched reviews online and looked some let's plays of the game. Yes the game has a lot of violence and blood but when you know the mafia history Then the game is very interesting. My son is 13 years old. So I told him you can have the Game but first you have to understand a little bit the mafia history. Then my son read a small book about the old Italian mafia. I bought him the game and I looked how he played the game and its a very cool game . The game is 18+ but that's because the violence and because they smoke and drink sometimes. But that was the mafia. And I think also the game is in the past so it's not so violent. And that was the time then. I like it:)",0
this game is such a good written story it's amazing but a few things about the game is violence is pretty bad since it about the mafia and is really realistic of how the mafia was then language is ok you know f word b word and there's no sex the only thing there is isthe strip club but you don't need to go there so if your 14 and older you can play it o and if your kid saw godfather good fellas or scarface you can play this game,0
dis game includes a vast amount of profanity and sexual themes,0
I never played Mafia games or watched the movie but the 3rd game is coming out and one of my son's wanted Mafia 2. I got it from GameStop surprised it was removed from steam. But I heard the game had playboys but they were removed in an update because if backlash and loss of the rights. The game has lots of guns and shooting in missions and blood comes from a gun shots. The game has a nice open world that lots of kids and adults would find fun. There is swearing throughout the game but ALL Cutsceneces are able to be skipped. The game also has great cars it looks like older cars and the radios play older songs like book of love and life could be a dream. There are bars but no stripclubs or that stuff in the game. This game may have a Mature rating but I think it deserves a second chance. I highly urge you to play this game if you can find it.,0
It is a great learning experience and expands kids cultural views. Its not like kids are going to go out and do the very few questionable things in the game. Great learning experience,1
"Pretty decent game, but it is over the top violent, lots of sex, alcohol, tobacco, drugs and cursing. I am not generally affected my foul language, but the ""F"" word was used so often that I had to walk away from it a few times.",0
I love the game but the violence and the language and the nudity is not for KIDS it should be played by MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY,0
"For the record, I love this game, but I got it for an 18th birthday present and it should be kept as an 18th birthday present. It's a very good story , but it sends wrong messages, there is too much sex and nudity for kids, and the role models aren't meant for kids",0
"I love Mafia games and movies and this is definitely my favorite game. My son, thirteen also enjoys these so I let him play this. Overall, the shooting you do isn't so bloody or violent, but the cut scenes are brutally violent (such as a man being cut to death by several knives) and sexual (a gentlemen's club with a BJ). However, the cut scenes can be skipped. Heavy use of F and SH. Alcohol, tobacco and dope were sold. Vito is portrayed as a man who cares about his family, even though he does resort to violence sometime. Great game, just skip the cut scenes to make it appropriate.",0
"Dragon Age was originally violent with people getting dismembered and a very hack and slash nature. The DLC of dragon age is obviously going to be pretty identical. But this is a little worse in my opinion because its quite noticeable that the gore is higher than Dragon Age: Origins. Yes, I know its DLC for Origins. Some skeletons and gory parts in this doesn't really make it very appropiate, Some suggestive Sexual content and not a truck load of swearing, Gore, like Origins is the main concern.",0
"The game is well made. In the game you use hundreds of creative weapons to kill zombies. When zombies are killed, there is a small amount of blood on the ground. It fades after 2-4 minutes. Zombies only have gruesome deaths if the player uses explosives. Though chainsaws and whatnot can be used to remove limbs, it is entirely comical in its appearance and completely unrealistic. In some occasions, the player can chop zombies in half. This is suppressing considering the nature of the game, however it can only be done with certain weapons, and it is very quick that you could blink and miss it. The sharing is minimal. S--t is used along with other milder profanities, people are called names like a - hole and p---y, but it isn't anything that your child will not ever hear. There are many references to drinking throughout. The only reason that the game got an M rating is the blood l, which is bright red and unrealistic. The game does have online features, but I don't let my 10 year old play that quite yet. I only let him play with people he knows with my supervison.",0
The F word is used occasionally. Plus some strong violence is added in. My ESRB rating M for sequences of strong violence and gore and some language.,0
"Yes there is blood, language, nudity, ect. So don't let kids under thirteen play it. Simple. Anyone thirteen and up, have at it! It's a blast to play! I usually end up shrieking at the game system because I am not skilled enough to play it so I always loose. Ha ha, it is a fun game. Recommended.",0
"Castlevania Lord of Shadows is a great action game which you play as Gabriel, which you venture through horror and fantasy themed environment fighting creatures like vampires and werewolves. For the violence, it is pretty intense and bloody, which you use your cross-shaped whip weapon to dispatch and dismember your foes with rather graphic and gory results. There is no sex in this game, however there are some creatures in the game which show some graphic nudity such as bare breasts.",0
This game is awesome! I recommend it to anyone!,1
"This game has 3 main concerns. Violence, sex references and swearing. First the violence is strong and in some ways impracticable, with heads flying off unrealistically. The level of violence is similar to Skyrim, a similar game in all aspects. The game is in no way glorifying violence, and is in no way a shoot-em-up. Parents must think about their child and their understanding of how violence must not be tolerated. Though the actual combat is not abundantly gruesome hand to hand fighting, the violence is present and in no way entirely avoidable.
The sex is scarce and though prostitution is present in one of the regions, it is not accepted anywhere else. The prostitutes can be talked with but that is the extent of any interaction. Their clothing is revealing and 'slutty' but there is no real nudity throughout the game.
Swearing is common but remains in the means of *ss, d*ck, cr*p and other curses. there is a rare f*ck and sh*it but nothing outrageous or not found on TV or at home (let's be honest).
The only other concern is alcohol and drugs. The drugs can be taken but in addition to the blurred screen, mimicking the real life effects, the player can become addicted and they can have bad consequences. The view of drugs is that they are fun but this is an extremely small part of the game.
Overall this is an amazing game and your child will have lots of fun on this. The game is segmented into quests and can be saved quickly so youre child can easily be taken off of it.
I hope you found this helpful :)",0
"Right off the bat it is clear why this game has an M rating, there is blood and gore, profanity (one character uses the ""f"" word about ten times in one sentence at one point), references to sex and depictions of alcohol and drug use. However, it is entirely in the hands of the player to decide how to interact with this world, one can (and I have) play this game without harming another person or creature once. This game also provides surprisingly deep quests which test not just the player's resolve and skills, but their morality and politics. For example one quest has you uncover where stolen water is being sent and the culprits are only stealing it so that their community can remain independent from the governments vying for power, can theft be tolerated if it is being done to feed the starving and keep people free? Each major faction also has a political stance and are more than happy to share their philosophy with the player. When the leader of the shockingly evil slaving faction (the legion) is asked how he justifies his atrocities he busts out Hegelian dialectics and ancient history to support his cause, when citizens of the flawed and struggling republic (the NCR) are asked why they support their government they might respond with either a patriotic speech or an intellectual defense of the virtues of liberty and egalitarianism. While playing this game you will constantly be forced to make tough decisions that are engaging on an intellectual, philosophical, and emotional level which is an important thing for teenagers to be doing. Another important thing this game does is treat sexuality with respect. Two companions in this game are gay and they aren't treated any differently for it. They aren't ashamed to mention it when it comes up and there is no dialogue option to treat them with incredulity for it, few games treat gay characters with such respect and equality today and this game is over a decade old! This game is extremely engaging and can really test not just a teenager, but also an adult's perceptions of the world and right and wrong. While the game is beginning to show its age, if someone wants to try it out I cannot recommend it enough so long as you are aware of the violence on the surface and heavy themes underneath.",0
It's soo good it's hard to describe,1
"It's true that this game contains violence, drug use, and some suggestive content, but what game doesn't these days? Quite frankly, it doesn't seem like something that should be restricted to children, but you should probably check if your child is mature and understanding enough of the fact that some things in the game should not be recreated in real life. While it does contain some suggestive content and drug use, it isn't very strong. And it does seem to teach kids life lessons, because the game does reward good behavior and punish bad behavior (generally speaking).",0
"I am a long-time gamer and this is easily one of my all-time favorite games, but I feel very strongly that this game is not appropriate for children age 12 and under. The biggest issues for me are the violence and drug-use. The violence is extremely over-the-top, if you play this game for no more than a few minutes you will probably see at least one head exploding in slow-motion and in graphic detail. Limbs can be severed in combat and it is possible to dismember corpses. It is true that the graphics are far from photo-realistic, but the levels of violence are so extreme that I really don't think it matters. Another troubling aspect of the violence is that it is not uncommon to witness characters being tortured, dismembered or just generally brutalized even if the player chooses to play as a pacifist.
The drug use is even more troubling. Although ""chems"" (fallout slang for drugs) have negative side-effects in the game there are certain chems that the player must use to be successful. Moreover, the negative consequences for drug use really aren't severe enough (it is not possible to die from an overdose, for example). I feel like this is a very dangerous message for kids. Also, unlike most games the drugs are presented in a very realistic manner, instead of ""potions"" or generic ""first-aid kits"" Fallout uses items such as bottles of prescription pills, syringes or inhalers as power ups, once again a very bad message for young players.
Although there are no explicit sex scenes, sex is a big part of this game and basically unavoidable. There are prostitutes and it is also possible to have sexual encounters with a few other characters in the game, although the screen blacks-out during these encounters the audio continues. Compared to the violence and drug use the sex is not nearly as prevalent, but still inappropriate in my opinion.
Profanity is also commonly used throughout the game, but this is a minor concern when compared to some of the other aspects.
All-in-all I would say some teenagers may be mature enough to handle this game, but even then I really think a responsible parent should have a frank discussion with the kid about the use of drugs in this game beforehand.",0
Kids stay out of this game this game has sexual and band language used in cutsences,0
"As the title of the games shows - this is about assassin's. That means that violence and killing are definitely part of the game. I would start out playing the game with your child to make sure that they know that this is not reality. The majority of children already know this, but it's good to make sure.
A lot of the buildings and people are taken from real life. What they actually are has been changed for the games. But it is a good learning experience to look up to see if the buildings were real and if the people were real and if they really did do the things that the games show. For instance the Auditore family, including Ezio, were not real. The Borgia's were definitely real, as were Machiavelli and Leonardo di Vinci. But their actions in this game did not (for the most part) take place.
Ezio does not kill the innocent. He kills only what he is supposed to kill, and if the player misses and acidently kills an innocent, the game states that Ezio did not kill the innocent. If more innocents are killed the memory will restart. In fact, in the games he comes to the aid of women and children that need help. The programmers, also, gave him a great sense of humor.
Some other reviewer mentioned the paintings. These were done by the Painter Raphael. They are considered classics. This would be another learning experience for both parents and children. Finding out who Raphael was, where he lived and what the period was like. In Assassin's Creed II, there were a lot of Classics done by various artists.
Another learning experience is that the Templar's were not, in real life, the bad guys, and the term hashishiyya or hashishi as used by Muslim sources is used metaphorically in its abusive sense (i.e. ""irreligious social outcasts"", ""low-class rabble"", etc.). ""The literal interpretation of this term in referring to the Nizaris (as hashish consuming intoxicated assassins) is rooted in the fantasies of medieval Westerners and their imaginative ignorance of Islam and the Ismailis. These supposedly medieval fantasies were still in vogue as late as 1990 until the publication of the ground breaking book on the Ismailis by the Twelver Shia author and researcher in original documents in Arabic and Persian that had been discovered in the late 20th century concerning the Ismailis in general and the Nizari Ismailis in particular. (This citation is from Daftary, Farhad (1990). The Ismailis: Their history and doctrines. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Page 13)
The two sides in this game were not, in reality, rivals or enemies. It's just that you cannot have a game without good guys and bad guys. So creative license has been taken in order to make a very good game.",0
"Way to much sex in it as in a cutseen a man sexually
Attacks a woman saying "" I'm sick and tired of having
To open your legs"" an then you attack the guy. Lots of assassinations to some bad and good guys. NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!!",0
"This game contains strong violence, yes, but you can turn off blood. The sexuality is very brief, and profanity is nothing your kids haven't heard. This is an awesome game, I recommend it for everyone",0
"Assassins creed brotherhood should not be a problem for a teen. Most reviews say the three problems are language, sex, and violence. The entire game includes less than 3 uses of the f word or s*** in English although there are many uses of h*ll, d*mn and other words that are not even bleeped out on tv. The violence consists of sword fighting and killing criminals with a knife. It is not more bloody than any shooting game out there and not something your kid will copy because the entire game is set in renaissance Italy hundreds of years ago. The sexual themes include a scene in which the main character is in bed with a woman but the scene fades out before any nudity is shown. Also you can hire prostitutes working in the streets to distract enemy guards so you do not have to fight them. All in all you could watch one episode of csi or burn notice which is rated tv-pg and see much worse things in all three areas of concern. For me the only thing I wasn't sure about was the theme that your child is controlling somebody who runs around a city performing premeditated assassinations. This kind of bugged me but than I thought it was better than many games that have you shooting people and many of those are rated T. Also all of the people you kill are historically real people who were weapon dealers, corrupt warlords, or other evil people with power. Hope this helped.",0
"This is a game that try's to accurately depict a very violent, and unstable period of time. Let it be known that there are messages hidden under the violence (of which there are admittedly large amounts) some of which have to do with the gray line between right and wrong, as well as the way that the government, and the general population view reformed criminals. If you take time to explain some of the deeper meanings to your child there are undeniable benefits to letting them play this game. The Undead Nightmare DLC is an excellent look at how, in reality the actions of most people are little more than that of a reanimated corpse. Beyond this it is an excellent way to have your children overcome some preconceived notions about different types of people. By letting them play any game where social statuses are severely redefined allows an excellent chance to show that under all the societal boundaries that we put up we are not all that different. There are still things that you need to consider when allowing your children to play this or any other game, mainly being is your child able to look at a game and see beyond what is at face value, and if not are they at least able to handle what is present to them and put it to use in a beneficial way. Overall, I feel that after the age of 15, it is permissible to allow any children to play this game, as long as they are able to see deeper meanings, or understand that the actions that are permissible in video games are not necessarily accepted in real life. Despite how I feel, it is ultimately based upon the maturity of the child that you have raised.",0
My son loves the show so we saw this and bought it our son was thrilled to have a mission from the paw patrol,1
Most of the puzzles are extremely easy for the youngest of the audience I suggested. The second half start to get a little challenging which is great.,1
"This is an easy to understand puzzle game with beautiful, charming graphics that will appeal to most children. Beating the game will be easy enough for even young children, while bonus objectives can tax the minds of people of any age. Of note, despite what the official review says, Toads are a genderless race, meaning Toadette is no different than Captain Toad from a gender standpoint. Plus, players play half the game as Toadette and half as Captain Toad, so both characters are equally represented as the hero and the person needing rescue.",1
"Thoroughly enjoyable puzzle game with the sort of polish and attention to detail you would expect from a Nintendo title. Regarding Marc Saltzman's review above (which I largely agree with), it should be noted that although Toad is compelled to rescue Toadette, the roles are reversed later on. Also, according to Nintendo, the Toads are genderless so that may be a point of discussion between parents and children.",1
"i think that this game is absolutely amazing, i had it when i was younger and now have bought it for my younger siblings, very entertaining and never get bored!!",1
"Amazing visuals and music. Once you won the race you think you're finished, but there so much else to do. A must have for the 3DS.",1
"This is a really fun game to one of the most popular racing games ever! Now on this game, you can customize your own kart, with many different wheels, bodies, and gliders! And gliding through the air in some moments is really cool in 3D! Although it does have the same objectives like the other old Mario Kart games, it is still very fun to play! Mario fans, if you got a 3DS, don't skip this game!",1
my son just loves dora and why not she is pretty good at teaching kids.,1
"Growing up with two little sisters who both loved Barbie was interesting for me. But I always loved games, which was something neither of them seemed to have much of a passion for...then my parents bought this game and suddenly, they were obsessed. They literally played it over and over and over...the game is quite short too, but they just loved it so much.
It really isn't that much of a game in terms of plot or storyline...basically, you are an interior decorator, decorating the castle, painting the walls, making it pretty pink Barbie sparkle beautiful. But I surprised myself at enjoying it as well. Its an incredibly simple game, but it's kind of fun to decorate the rooms and argue over who made the prettiest castle. I know my sisters enjoyed it!",1
"My son loves this game. I've tried many math games, and this is the one that my son likes the most.",1
"Very interesting and slightly challenging games to aid learning; nice graphics and a great story line. Students love it they all watch others progression and impatiently wait to play it. As a teacher at Phoebe Hearst Elementary, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a resource to help education 1st or 2nd graders. Overall, I found this to be an excellent learning tool for young children.",1
"An excellent entry level game. Young kids will enjoy just skating around as their favorite Disney characters. Older kids will get a lot out of the depth of play and some interesting level design.
Product placement is bothersome. I can't really speak to it, as each parent has different attitudes on it and how they feel they should react to it. Suffice to say it isn't prevalent on earlier levels.
Music may not be age appropriate in all cases. The option does exist to lower the volume on the background music while keeping the SFX and dialog at a reasonable levels.
All in all, as someone who has played the Tony Hawk Games, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure has surprising depth while being very easy for a 4 or 5 year old to pick up and skate around.
Enjoy!",1
i like it because you ride a horse and you can look for the stuff they needs to find the other horse,1
"It is Pokemon, not much more needs to be told. Of course a lot of battles and beautiful trainer girls. Beside battles there are endless amount of World exploring, so many classic themes just to have in the background, side quests and much more that I could go on for days.",1
"It was a pretty good game. To the one person who claims that the newer games are Digimon rip-offs I would like to say that the two series are totally different. Yes generation 2 has eggs and Digimon always had ""Digi-eggs but Digimon is based off of keychain ""Digi-Pets"" and Tamagotchi pets. Pokemon is simply a game series with an anime and some spin offs. And yes Pokemon DID rip off some characters like Ledyba and Tentamon and the fact that mega evolution is similar to Digivolving in the anime but the game mechanics are totally different if you go by the RPG titles. And I like both series of course and even Yo-Kai Watch and Monster Rancher because I consider monster training a genre of it's own.",1
It's was the first Pokemon game that I've ever played and I really loved it!,1
"This (LeafGreen) was my first pokemon game, and I love it. It's entirely appropriate for kids, as long as you make sure they understand the difference between real and fiction. A great starter game.",1
"This game is OK, if you set some time limits on the kids play. Perhaps the greatest problem is the time lost to the game from activities with other people/activities which require more motion.",1
"this teaches children to be resourcceful and to use what they have availabe. it also lets them practice logical thinking by giving hints on where the player should go next to go farther along in the game, and how to get past obsticals in an efficient and effective way. though it has animal against animal violence, it has no blood or gore that is prevelent in most best sellers today.",1
I have this game and it is an amazing game where you design fashions for certain events! it is very fun. You can suit the fashions to your own style which is amazing.,1
i love it and its helped me out a lot,1
"i love playing it ,it is so much fun to play with it",1
is this game a good game i played it before and thought it was awesome,1
"This isn't the best GameCube game ever, but it's still very fun. Good for the whole family.",1
"I bought this game based on the reviews at Commonsensemedia, we were not disapointed, my daughter who has just turned 6 loves it. would definately recommend.",1
This will always be fantastic.,1
i liked that game i wanted to play it!,1
Wow what a game and I thought I wasn't interested but this is a perfect girl game.,1
This is agreat learning tool for pre-schoolers.,1
this is a god games for all kids.,1
"Spongebob is a fun show it shows where he works and how to make krabby pattys. Spongebob goes on adventures that kids would like to do like surfing, camping or jelly fishing. It's just want your kids to like adventure maybe want to become a fry cook and get money. Also hanging out with your best friend ya pal ya buddy.",1
"I have always loved the Pokemon games. This isn't the best of them; I'd recommend HeartGold/SoulSilver before this, because they are remakes of old, excellent Pokemon games that are much better than this. Or just wait until Pokemon White and Black versions come out. This game was entertaining. Fun, even. But not the best there is. It feels like Nintendo has run out of ideas when it comes to pokemon and is digging through a trash bin, turning every random thing they can think of into a pokemon. This game is fun but not nearly as good as they used to be. Actually, if you really want to be economical, go out and buy a used Gameboy Color Silver, Gold, Yellow, Red, or Blue Version. They are better than the new ones and you can get them for a quarter a piece now.",1
"My 8 year old bought Pearl and my 11 year old bought Diamond, both with their allowance money saved up. They bought this game in mid-May, and they have been playing it nearly non-stop ever since! (it's now early July) They love trading pokemon with each other and friends, and they were completely excited that they could migrate from previous versions and into the new Pokemon Battle Revolution game for the Wii. This one's definitely worth the money as far as holding their interest! Challenging for both boys, but well within reach.",1
"this game has a really good storyline, game play is depicted with minimal violence and out of this world graphics while the use of profanity is few and far between. an amazing hit especially if you want your child to be able to play a game like this without the blood and gore. AMAZING.",1
This game will always be awesome for me!,1
first game that I've ever played and I absolutely loved it!,1
they have exceeded expectations and done a good job!!!,1
it is so much fun to play with it,1
Amazing visuals and music. Incredible storyline and plot. Recommend!,1
very fun. Good for the entire family to play.,1
will never forget how much fun this game was!,1
this is a very nostalgic game I used to play when I was younger. Recommend!,1
It has a surprisingly solid story with good boss battles.,1
